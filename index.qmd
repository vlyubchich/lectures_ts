## Preface {.unnumbered}

This is a collection of lectures on applied time series analysis and forecasting using R. 
Many of the lectures are based on the original notes by Y. R. Gel for the course STAT-443 *Forecasting* (University of Waterloo, Canada) adapted and expanded by V. Lyubchich for the course MEES-713 *Environmental Statistics 2* (University of Maryland, USA).

Each lecture starts by listing the learning objectives and required reading materials, while additional references can be found in the text. The notes introduce the methods and give a few data examples, but are less detailed than the reading materials. The notes do not substitute a textbook.

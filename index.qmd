## Preface {.unnumbered}

This is a collection of lecture notes on applied time series analysis and forecasting using the statistical programming language R. 
Many of these lectures are based on the original notes by Y. R. Gel and C. Cutler for the course STAT-443 *Forecasting* (University of Waterloo, Canada) adapted and expanded by V. Lyubchich for the course MEES-713 *Environmental Statistics 2* (University of Maryland, USA).

Each lecture starts by listing the learning objectives and required reading materials, with additional references in the text. The notes introduce the methods and give a few examples but are less detailed than the reading materials. The notes do not substitute a textbook.

\section{Introduction}

By now, we have been working in the \emph{time domain}, such that our analysis could be seen as a regression of present on the past (for example, ARIMA models). We have been using many time series plots with time on the x-axis.

An alternative approach is to analyze time series in a \emph{spectral domain}, such that use a regression of present on a linear combination of sine and cosine functions. In this type of analysis, we will often use periodogram plots, with frequency or period on the x-axis.



\section{Regression on sinusoidal components}
The simplest form of spectral analysis consists of regression on a periodic component:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:regr}
Y_t = A\cos \omega t + B \sin \omega t + C + \epsilon_t,
\end{equation}
where $t =1,\ldots,T$; $\epsilon_t \sim WN(0, \sigma^2)$. Without loss of generality, we assume $0 \leqslant \omega \leqslant \pi$. In fact, for discrete data, frequencies outside this range are aliased into this range. For example, suppose that $-\pi < (\omega = \pi - \delta) < 0$, then 
$$\cos(\omega t) = \cos((\pi - \delta)t) = \cos(\pi t) \cos(\delta t) + \sin(\pi t) \sin(\delta t) = \cos(\delta t).$$
Hence, a sampled sinusoid with frequency smaller than 0, appears to coincide
with a sinusoid with frequency from $[0, \pi]$.

\textbf{Remark} The term $A\cos \omega t + B \sin \omega t$ is a periodic function with period $\frac{2\pi}{\omega}$. The period $\frac{2\pi}{\omega}$ represents the number of time units that it takes for the function to take the same value again, i.e., to complete a cycle. The frequency, measured in cycles per time unit, is given by the inverse $\frac{\omega}{2\pi}$. The angular frequency,
measured in radians per time unit, is given by $\omega$. Because of its convenience, the angular frequency $\omega$ will be used to describe periodicity of the function, and its name is shortened to frequency, when there is no danger of confusion.

\textbf{Example} 
Consider the monthly data that exhibit a 12-month seasonality.
Hence, the period $\frac{2\pi}{\omega}$ is equal to 12, which implies that the angular frequency $\omega = \frac{\pi}{6}$.  The frequency, measured in cycles per time unit, is given by the inverse $\frac{\omega}{2\pi} = \frac{1}{12} \approx 0.08$.

The formulas to estimate parameters of regression~(\ref{eq:regr}) take a much simpler form if $\omega$ is one of the Fourier frequencies,
defined by
$$\omega_j=\frac{2\pi j}{T}, \quad  j=0,\ldots, \frac{T}{2},$$
then 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\hat{A}&=&\frac{2}{T}\sum_t Y_t\cos \omega_jt,\\
\hat{B}&=&\frac{2}{T}\sum_t Y_t\sin \omega_jt,\\
\hat{C}&=&\overline{Y}=\frac{1}{T}\sum_tY_t.
\end{eqnarray*}

A suitable way of testing the significance of the sinusoidal component with
frequency $\omega_j$ is using its contribution to the sum of squares
$$R_T(\omega_j)=\frac{T}{2}\left( \hat{A}^2+\hat{B}^2 \right).$$
If the $\epsilon_t \sim N(0, \sigma^2)$, then it follows that $\hat{A}$ and $\hat{B}$ are also independent normal
each with variance $2\sigma^2/T$, so under the null hypothesis $A = B = 0$, we find that
$$\frac{R_T(\omega_j)}{\sigma^2}\sim \chi_2^2$$
or equivalently that $R_T(\omega_j)/(2\sigma^2)$ has an exponential distribution with mean 1.
The above theory is easily extended to simultaneous estimation of several
periodic components.




\section{Periodogram}

The periodogram is
defined as
\begin{equation}
I_T(\omega) = \frac{1}{2\pi T}\left| \sum_{t=1}^T Y_te^{i\omega t} \right|^2,
\end{equation}
that it is an approximately unbiased
estimator of the spectral density $f$.

Some undesirable features of the periodogram:
\begin{itemize}
\item $I_T(\omega)$ for fixed $\omega$ is not a consistent estimate of $f(\omega)$, since 
$$
I_T(\omega_j) \sim \frac{f(\omega_j)}{2} \chi^2_2
$$
Therefore variance of $f^2(\omega)$ does not tend to 0 as $T \rightarrow \infty$.

\item Also, the independence of periodogram ordinates at different Fourier frequencies
suggests that the sample periodogram, plotted as a function of $\omega$,
will be extremely irregular.
\end{itemize}

Suppose that $\gamma(h)$ is the autocovariance function of a stationary process and that $f (\omega)$ is the spectral density for the same process.  %In the notation of the previous sentence, $h$ = time lag and $\omega$ = frequency.
The autocovariance and the spectral density have the following relationships:

$$\gamma(h) = \int_{-1/2}^{1/2} e^{2\pi i \omega h} f(\omega) d \omega,$$
and
$$f(\omega) = \sum_{h=-\infty}^{h=\infty} \gamma(h) e^{-2\pi i \omega h}$$

In the language of advanced calculus, the autocovariance and spectral density are Fourier transform pairs.  %We won’t worry about the calculus of the situation.  We’ll focus on the estimation of the spectral density – the frequency domain characterization of a series.  
The Fourier transform equations show that there is a direct link between the time domain representation and the frequency domain representation of a time series.

\section{Smoothing}
The idea behind smoothing is to take weighted averages over neighboring frequencies in order to reduce the variability associated with individual
periodogram values. However, such an operation necessarily introduces some bias into the estimation procedure. Theoretical studies focus on the amount
of smoothing that is required to obtain an optimum trade-off between bias and
variance. In practice, this usually means that choice of a kernel and amount of smoothing is somewhat subjective.

The main form of smoothed estimator is given by
\begin{equation}
\hat{f}(\lambda) = \int^{\pi}_{-\pi}\frac{1}{h}K\left( \frac{\omega-\lambda}{h}\right)I_T(\omega)d\omega,
\end{equation}
where $I_T(\cdot)$ is the periodogram based on $T$ observations, $K(\cdot)$ is a kernel function
and $h$ is the bandwidth. We usually take $K(\cdot)$ to be a non-negative function, symmetric about 0, and integrating to 1. Thus, any symmetric density, such as the normal, will work. In practice, however, it is more usual to take a kernel of finite range, such as the \emph{Epanechnikov kernel}
\begin{equation}
K(x)=\frac{3}{4\sqrt{5}}\left(1-\frac{x^2}{5} \right), \quad -\sqrt{5}\leq x \leq \sqrt{5},
\end{equation}
that is 0 outside $[-\sqrt{5}, \sqrt{5}]$. This choice of kernel function has some optimality
properties. However, in practice this optimality is less important than the choice
of bandwidth $h$, which effectively controls the range over which the periodogram
is smoothed.


There are some additional difficulties with the performance of the sample periodogram in the presence of a sinusoidal variation whose frequency is not one of
the Fourier frequencies. This effect is known as \emph{leakage.} The reason of leakage is that we always consider a truncated periodogram. Truncation implicitly
assumes that the time series is periodic with period $T$, which, of course, is not
always true. So we artificially introduce non-existent periodicities into the estimated
spectrum, i.e., cause ``leakage'' of the spectrum. (If time series is perfectly
periodic over $T$ then there is no leakage.) The leakage can be treated using an operation of tapering on the periodogram, i.e., by choosing appropriate periodogram
windows.

\textbf{Remark.} When we work with periodograms, we lose all phase (relative location/time origin) information: the periodogram will be the same if all the
data were circularly rotated to a new time origin, i.e., the observed data are treated as perfectly periodic.

By default, Daniell kernel (with parameter $m$) is used.   
For time series, it is a centered moving average that creates a smoothed value at time $t$ by averaging all values between times $t- m$ and $t+m$ (inclusive).  For example, the smoothing formula for a Daniell kernel with $m = 2$ is
$$
\hat{x}_t = \frac{x_{t-2}+x_{t-1}+x_t + x_{t+1}+x_{t+2}}{5}
$$

In R, the weighting coefficients for a Daniell kernel with $m = 2$ can be generated with the command 
<<>>=
kernel("daniell", 2)
@

The subscripts for \texttt{coef[ ]} refer to the time difference from the center of the average at time $t$. Thus, the smoothing formula in this instance is
$$\hat{x}_t = 0.2x_{t-2} + 0.2x_{t-1} +0.2x_t + 0.2x_{t+1} +0.2x_{t+2},$$
which is the same as the formula given above.

The modified Daniell kernel is such that the two endpoints in the averaging receive half the weight that the interior points do.  For a modified Daniell kernel with $m = 2$, the smoothing is
$$\hat{x}_t = \frac{x_{t-2}+2x_{t-1}+2x_t + 2x_{t+1} + x_{t+2}}{8} = 0.125x_{t-2} +0.25x_{t-1}+0.25x_t+0.25x_{t+1}+0.125x_{t+2}$$

List the weighting coefficients in R:
<<>>=
  kernel("modified.daniell", 2)
@

Either the Daniell kernel or the modified Daniell kernel can be convoluted (repeated) so that the smoothing is applied again to the smoothed values.  This produces a more extensive smoothing by averaging over a wider time interval.  For instance, to repeat a Daniell kernel with $m = 2$ on the smoothed values that resulted from a Daniell kernel with $m = 2$, the formula would be
$$\hat{\hat{x}}_t = \frac{\hat{x}_{t-2}+\hat{x}_{t-1}+\hat{x}_t +\hat{x}_{t+1}+\hat{x}_{t+2}}{5}$$

This is the average of the smoothed values within two time periods of time $t$, in either direction.

In R, the command 
<<>>=
  kernel("daniell", c(2,2))
@
supplies the coefficients that would be the weights in averaging the original data for a convoluted Daniell kernel with $m = 2$ in both smoothings. This generates the smoothing formula
$$\hat{x}_t = 0.04x_{t-4} + 0.08x_{t-3} +0.12x_{t-2} +0.16x_{t-1} +0.20x_t +0.16x_{t+1} +0.12x_{t+2} +0.08x_{t+3}+0.04x_{t+4}.$$

A convolution of the modified method in which the end points have less weight is also possible, with the command 
<<>>=
  kernel("modified.daniell",c(2,2)) 
@

Thus, the center values are weighted slightly more heavily than in the unmodified Daniell kernel.

When we smooth a periodogram, we are smoothing across a frequency interval rather than a time interval.

The x-axis corresponds to $\frac{\omega}{2\pi}$. Notice that we have a very large peak at an
approximate frequency 1, which implies one cycle per year (if the frequency of 12 was not specifically stated as in the R code above, the frequency axis would be different, and spectrum peak would correspond to $\approx 0.08$). 

Notice that you can use the confidence band in the upper right corner to get
an approximate idea how significant the peak is.

Another method of testing the reality of a peak is to look at its harmonics. It
is extremely unlikely that a true cycle will be shaped perfectly as a sine curve
and at least the first few harmonics will show up as well. For example, if we
have monthly data with annual seasonality (12 months period) then almost certainly the periodogram will not look as a perfect sine function. In contrast, the peaks at 6-, 4-, 3-months and possibly others will show up and
will be also of importance if 12-month peak is important (see Granger, 1964 for
more discussion). It is interesting that this is exactly the pattern that we see in the figures above.

We can try to approximate our data with an AR model and then plot the approximating periodogram of an AR model.

  spectrum(Choc, method="ar")
@

The series should be detrended prior to a spectral analysis.  A trend will cause such a dominant spectral density at a low frequency that other peaks won't be seen.  By default, the R command \texttt{spec.pgram} performs detrending using a linear trend model.  That is, the spectral density is estimated using the residuals from a regression done where the y-variable is observed data and the x-variable is time $t$.  If a different type of trend is present, a quadratic for instance, then a polynomial regression could be used to detrend the data before the estimated spectral density is explored.  Note, that the R command \texttt{spec.ar}, does not detrend time series.

\section{Conclusion}
For challenging problems, smoothing, multitapering, linear
filtering, (repeated) pre-whitening and Lomb--Scargle can be
used together. Beware that aperiodic but autoregressive
processes produce peaks in the spectral densities. Harmonic
analysis is a complicated `art' rather than a straightforward
`procedure'.

It is extremely difficult to derive the significance of a weak
periodicity from harmonic analysis. Do not believe analytical
estimates (e.g., exponential probability), as they rarely apply to
real data. It is essential to make simulations, typically
permuting or bootstrapping the data keeping the observing
times fixed. Simulations of the final model with the
observation times is also advised.

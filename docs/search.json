    "text": "1.1 Diagnostics for the simple linear regression: residual analysis\nGiven a simple linear regression (SLR) model \\[\nY_{t} = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1} X_{t} + \\epsilon_{t},\n\\] where \\(Y_{t}\\) is the dependent variable and \\(X_{t}\\) is the regressor (independent, predictor) variable, \\(t = 1,\\ldots,n\\), and \\(n\\) is the sample size.\nThe Gauss–Markov theorem If \\(\\epsilon_{t}\\) are uncorrelated random variables with common variance, then of all possible estimators \\(\\beta^{\\ast}_{0}\\) and \\(\\beta^{\\ast}_{1}\\) that are linear functions of \\(Y_{t}\\), the least squares estimators have the smallest variance.\nThus, the ordinary least squares (OLS) assumptions are:\n\nthe residuals \\(\\epsilon_{t}\\) have common variance (\\(\\epsilon_{t}\\) are homoscedastic);\nthe residuals \\(\\epsilon_{t}\\) are uncorrelated;\nto provide prediction intervals (PIs), confidence intervals (CIs), and to test hypotheses about the parameters in our model, we also need to assume that\nthe residuals \\(\\epsilon_{t}\\) are normally distributed (\\(\\epsilon_{t} \\sim N (0, \\sigma^{ 2} )\\)).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf the residuals are independent and identically distributed and normal (\\(\\epsilon_{t} \\sim\\) i.i.d. \\(N(0, \\sigma^{2}\\))), then all three above properties are automatically satisfied. In this case, \\(\\epsilon_{t}\\) are not only uncorrelated, \\(\\epsilon_{t}\\) are independent. To be independent is a much stronger property than to be uncorrelated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWhile a given model may still have useful predictive value even when the OLS assumptions are violated, the confidence intervals, prediction intervals, and \\(p\\)-values associated with the \\(t\\)-statistics will generally be incorrect when the OLS assumptions do not hold.\n\n\nA basic technique for investigating the aptness of a regression model is based on analyzing the residuals \\(\\epsilon_{t}\\). In a residual analysis we attempt to assess the validity of the OLS assumptions by examining the estimated residuals \\(\\hat{\\epsilon}_{1}, \\ldots, \\hat{\\epsilon}_{n}\\) to see if they actually satisfy the imposed conditions. If the model is apt, the observed residuals should reflect the assumptions listed above.\nWe perform our diagnostics analysis from a step-by-step verification of each assumption. We start with visual diagnostics, then proceed with formal tests. A lot of useful diagnostic information may be obtained from a residual plot.\n\n1.1.1 Homoscedasticity\nWe plot the residuals \\(\\hat{\\epsilon}_{t}\\) vs. time, fitted values \\(\\hat{Y}_{t}\\), and predictor values \\(X_t\\). If the assumption of constant variance is satisfied, \\(\\hat{\\epsilon}_{t}\\) fluctuate around the zero mean with more or less constant amplitude and this amplitude does not change with time, fitted values \\(\\hat{Y}_{t}\\), and predictor values \\(X_t\\).\nIf the (linear) model is not appropriate, the mean of the residuals may be non-constant, i.e., not always 0. Figure 1.1 shows an example of random pattern that we would like the residuals to have (no systematic patterns).\n\n\nCode\nset.seed(1)\nn = 26; m = 0; s = 522\nx <- ts(rnorm(n, mean = m, sd = s))\nforecast::autoplot(x) + \n    geom_hline(yintercept = 0, lty = 2, col = 4) +\n    theme_light()\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: A time series plot of ‘ideal’ residuals. These residuals \\(x_t\\) are simulated i.i.d. normal.\n\n\n\n\nWhat can we notice in a residual plot?\n\nChange of variability with time indicates heterogeneity of variance of the residuals.\nObvious lack of symmetry (around 0) in the plot suggests a lack of normality or presence of outliers.\nSystematic trends in the residuals suggest correlations between the residuals or inadequateness of the proposed model.\n\nSometimes it is possible to transform the dependent or independent variables to remedy these problems, i.e., to get rid of the correlated residuals or to stabilize the variance.  Otherwise, we need to change (re-specify) the model.\nA useful technique that can guide us in this process is to plot \\(\\hat{\\epsilon}_{t}\\) vs. \\(\\hat{Y}_{t}\\) and \\(\\hat{\\epsilon}_{t}\\) vs. each predictor \\(X_t\\). Similarly to their time series plot, \\(\\hat{\\epsilon}_{t}\\) should fluctuate around the zero mean with more or less constant amplitude.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Dishwasher shipments model and patterns in residuals\n\n\n\nFigure 1.2 shows R code and residuals of a simple linear regression exploring dishwasher shipments (DISH) and private residential investments (RES) for a number of years.\nHow different are the patterns in Figure 1.2 from those in Figure 1.1?\n\n\nCode\nD <- read.delim(\"./data/dish.txt\") %>% \n    rename(Year = YEAR)\nmod1 <- lm(DISH ~ RES, data = D)\np1 <- ggplot(D, aes(x = Year, y = mod1$residuals)) + \n    geom_line() + \n    geom_hline(yintercept = 0, lty = 2, col = 4) + \n    ylab(\"Residuals\") +\n    theme_light()\np2 <- ggplot(D, aes(x = mod1$fitted.values, y = mod1$residuals)) + \n    geom_point() + \n    geom_hline(yintercept = 0, lty = 2, col = 4) + \n    xlab(\"Fitted values\") +\n    ylab(\"Residuals\") +\n    theme_light()\np3 <- ggplot(D, aes(x = RES, y = mod1$residuals)) + \n    geom_point() + \n    geom_hline(yintercept = 0, lty = 2, col = 4) + \n    xlab(\"Residential investments (RES)\") +\n    ylab(\"Residuals\") +\n    theme_light()\np1 + p2 + p3 +\n    plot_annotation(tag_levels = 'A')\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.2: Estimated residuals plotted vs. time, fitted values, and predictor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.1.2 Uncorrelatedness\nIt is a deep topic that we shall discuss many times in different variations in the future. When observations are obtained in a time sequence (the topic of time series analysis and of our course), there is a high possibility that the errors \\(\\epsilon_{t}\\) are correlated. For instance, if the residual is positive (or negative) for a given day \\(t\\), it is likely that the residual for the following day \\(t+1\\) is also positive (or negative). Such residuals are said to be autocorrelated (i.e., serially correlated). In many environmental time series autocorrelation is positive.\nWhen the residuals \\(\\epsilon_{t}\\) are related over time, a model for the residuals frequently employed is the first-order autoregressive model, i.e., the AR(1) model.\nThe autoregressive model of the first order, AR(1), is defined as \\[\n\\epsilon_{t} = \\rho \\epsilon_{t - 1} + u_{t},\n\\] where \\(\\rho\\) is the autoregression coefficient (\\(- 1 < \\rho < 1\\)) and \\(u_{t}\\) are uncorrelated \\(N (0, \\sigma^{2})\\).\nThe model assumes that the residual \\(\\epsilon_{t}\\) at time \\(t\\) contains a component resulting from the residual \\(\\epsilon_{t - 1}\\) at time \\(t - 1\\) and a random disturbance \\(u_{t}\\) that is independent of the earlier periods.\nEffects of autocorrelation If the OLS method is employed for the parameter estimation and the residuals \\(\\epsilon_{t}\\) are autocorrelated of the first order, then the consequences are:\n\nThe OLS estimators will still be unbiased, but they no longer have the minimum variance property (see the Gauss–Markov theorem); they tend to be relatively inefficient.\nThe residual mean square error (MSE) can seriously underestimate the true variance of the error terms in the model.\nStandard procedures for CI, PI, and tests using the \\(F\\) and Student’s \\(t\\) distributions are no longer strictly applicable.\n\nFor example, see Section 5.2 in Chatterjee and Simonoff (2013) for more details.\nDurbin–Watson test\nA widely used test for examining whether the residuals in a regression model are correlated is the Durbin–Watson test. This test is based on the AR(1) model for \\(\\epsilon_{t}\\). The one-tail test alternatives are \\[\n\\begin{align}\nH_{0}{:} ~ \\rho = 0 & ~~ vs. ~~ H_{1}{:} ~ \\rho > 0,\\\\\nH_{0}{:} ~ \\rho = 0 & ~~ vs. ~~ H_{1}{:} ~ \\rho < 0,\n\\end{align}\n\\] and the two-tail test is \\[\nH_{0}{:} ~ \\rho = 0 ~~ vs. ~~ H_{1}{:} ~ \\rho \\neq 0.\\\\\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWhen dealing with real data, the positive autocorrelation is usually the case.\n\n\nThe Durbin–Watson test statistic DW is based on the differences between the adjacent residuals, \\(\\epsilon_{t} - \\epsilon_{t - 1}\\), and is of the following form: \\[\n\\text{DW} = \\frac{\\sum^{n}_{t = 2} \\left( \\epsilon_{t} - \\epsilon_{t - 1} \\right)^{2}}{\\sum^{n}_{t = 1} \\epsilon^{2}_{t}},\n\\] where \\(\\epsilon_{t}\\) is the regression residual at time \\(t\\) and \\(n\\) is the number of observations.\nThe DW statistic takes on values in the range \\([0, 4]\\). In fact,\n\nWhen \\(\\epsilon_{t}\\) are positively correlated, adjacent residuals tend to be of similar magnitude so that the numerator of DW will be relatively small or 0.\nWhen \\(\\epsilon_{t}\\) are negatively correlated, adjacent residuals tend to be of similar magnitude but with the opposite sign so that the numerator of DW will be relatively large or equal to 4.\n\nHence, low DW corresponds to positive autocorrelation. Values of DW that tend towards 4 are in the region for negative autocorrelation.\nThe exact action limit for the Durbin–Watson test is difficult to calculate. Hence, the test is used with a lower bound \\(d_{L}\\) and an upper bound \\(d_{U}\\). %When the test statistic is less than \\(d_{L}\\), we conclude that the positive autocorrelation is present. When the test statistic exceeds the upper bound \\(d_{U}\\), we do not reject the \\(H_0\\). We may use Table 1.1 as a rule of thumb.\n\n\nTable 1.1: Regions of rejection of the null hypothesis for the Durbin–Watson test\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfrom 0 to \\(d_{L}\\)\nfrom \\(d_{L}\\) to \\(d_{U}\\)\nfrom \\(d_{U}\\) to \\(4 - d_{U}\\)\nfrom \\(4 - d_{U}\\) to \\(4 - d_{L}\\)\nfrom \\(4 - d_{L}\\) to 4\n\n\n\n\nReject \\(H_{0}\\), positive autocorrelation\nNeither accept \\(H_{1}\\) or reject \\(H_{0}\\)\nDo not reject \\(H_{0}\\)\nNeither accept \\(H_{1}\\) or reject \\(H_{0}\\)\nReject \\(H_{0}\\), negative autocorrelation\n\n\n\n\nThe critical values \\(d_{L}\\) and \\(d_{U}\\) have been tabulated for combinations of various sample sizes, significance levels, and number of regressors in a model. For large samples, normal approximation can be used (Chatterjee and Simonoff 2013): \\[\nz = \\left(\\frac{\\text{DW}}{2} - 1 \\right)\\sqrt{n}.\n\\] Statistical software packages usually provide exact \\(p\\)-values based on the null distribution of the test statistic (a linear combination of \\(\\chi^2\\) variables).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Dishwasher residuals DW test\n\n\n\nApply the Durbin–Watson test to the residuals from the dishwashers example, i.e., DISH vs. RES, using the R package lmtest.\n\n\nCode\nlmtest::dwtest(D$DISH ~ D$RES, alternative = \"greater\")\n\n\n#> \n#>  Durbin-Watson test\n#> \n#> data:  D$DISH ~ D$RES\n#> DW = 0.6, p-value = 3e-06\n#> alternative hypothesis: true autocorrelation is greater than 0\n\n\nBased on the low \\(p\\)-value we can reject the \\(H_{0}\\): \\(\\rho = 0\\) at the 95% confidence level and accept the alternative \\(H_{1}\\): \\(\\rho > 0\\).\n\n\nRuns test\nDepartures of randomness can take so many forms that no single test for randomness is best for all situations. For instance, one of the most common departures from randomness is the tendency of a sequence to persist in its direction of movement.\nWe can count the number of times a sequence of observations crossed a cut-off line, for example, the median line, and use this information to assess randomness of \\(\\epsilon_t\\). Alternatively we count a succession of plus or minus signs, surrounded by the opposite signs. Each such succession is called a run.\nThe formal test is the following. When a sequence of \\(N\\) observations with \\(n\\) observations in positive runs and \\(m\\) observations in negative runs is a random process with independent values generated from a continuous distribution, then the sampling distribution of the number of runs \\(R\\) has the mean and variance \\[\n\\mathrm{E}(R) = \\frac{1 + 2nm}{N}, \\qquad \\sigma^2(R) = \\frac{2nm(2nm-n-m)}{N^2(N-1)},\n\\] where \\(N = n + m\\) is the total sample size.\nThe only assumption for this test is that all sample observations come from a continuous distribution.\nThe two-tail alternative is as follows\n\n\\(H_{0}\\): Sequence is generated by a random process;\n\\(H_{1}\\): Sequence is generated by a process containing either persistence or frequent changes in direction.\n\nWhen positive autocorrelation (or persistence) is present, \\(R\\) will clearly be small. On the other hand, if the process involves frequent changes in direction (negative autocorrelation or anti-persistence), \\(R\\) will be too large.\nWhen the number of observations is sufficiently large, i.e., \\(N > 30\\), the runs test statistic \\(R\\) is based on the standardized normal test statistic \\[\nz = \\frac{R - \\mathrm{E}(R)}{ \\sigma(R)}.\n\\] Here \\(z\\) follows approximately a standard normal distribution.\nRuns test is very easy to interpret. Runs test allows to assess only the first order serial correlation in the residuals, i.e., to test whether two residuals that are one lag apart are correlated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Dishwasher residuals runs test\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\npar(mar = c(4, 5, 1, 1) + 0.1, mgp = c(3, 1, 0), mfrow = c(1, 2))\npar(pty = \"m\")\nlawstat::runs.test(x, plot.it = TRUE)\n\n\n#> \n#>  Runs Test - Two sided\n#> \n#> data:  x\n#> Standardized Runs Statistic = -0.4, p-value = 0.7\n\n\nCode\nlawstat::runs.test(mod1$residuals, plot.it = TRUE)\n\n\n#> \n#>  Runs Test - Two sided\n#> \n#> data:  mod1$residuals\n#> Standardized Runs Statistic = -3, p-value = 0.005\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.3: Runs tests and plots of independent normally distributed simulations \\(x_t\\) and the DISH residuals.\n\n\n\n\nThe \\(p\\)-value for the runs test for the residuals is very low (Figure 1.3), which supports findings of the DW test that residuals are first-order serially correlated.\n\n\n\n\n1.1.3 Normality\nThere are two major ways of checking normality. Graphical methods visualize differences between empirical data and theoretical normal distribution. Numerical methods conduct statistical tests on the null hypothesis that the variable is normally distributed.\n\n1.1.3.1 Graphical methods\nGraphical methods visualize the data using graphs, such as histograms, stem-and-leaf plot, box plot, etc. For example, Figure 1.4 shows a histogram of the simulated normally distributed data and the residuals from the dishwashers example with superimposed normal curves with the corresponding mean and standard deviation.\n\n\nCode\np1 <- ggplot(data.frame(x = x), aes(x = x)) + \n    geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..), binwidth = 300, fill = \"grey50\") +\n    stat_function(fun = dnorm, \n                  args = list(mean = mean(x), sd = sd(x)),\n                  col = 1, lwd = 1.5) +\n    ylab(\"Density\") +\n    ggtitle(\"Random normal values\") + \n    theme_light()\np2 <- ggplot(x, aes(x = mod1$residuals)) + \n    geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..), binwidth = 300, fill = \"grey50\") +\n    stat_function(fun = dnorm, \n                  args = list(mean = mean(mod1$residuals), sd = sd(mod1$residuals)),\n                  col = 1, lwd = 1.5) +\n    ylab(\"Density\") +\n    ggtitle(\"Model residuals\") + \n    theme_light()\np1 + p2 +\n    plot_annotation(tag_levels = 'A')\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.4: Histograms of the simulated normally distributed values and estimated regression residuals.\n\n\n\n\nAnother very popular graphical method of assessing normality is the quantile-quantile (Q-Q) plot. The Q-Q plot compares the ordered values of a variable with the corresponding ordered values of the normal distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nQ-Q plots can also be used to compare sample quantiles with quantiles of other, not normal, distribution (e.g., \\(t\\) or gamma distribution), or to compare quantiles of two samples (to assess if both samples come from the same, unspecified, distribution).\n\n\nLet \\(X\\) be a random variable having the property that the equation \\[\n\\Pr \\left( X \\leqslant x \\right) = \\alpha\n\\] has a unique solution \\(x = x_{(\\alpha)}\\) for each \\(0 < \\alpha < 1\\). That is, there exists \\(x_{(\\alpha)}\\) such that \\[\n\\Pr \\left( X \\leqslant x_{(\\alpha)} \\right) = \\alpha\n\\tag{1.1}\\] and no other value of \\(x\\) satisfies Equation 1.1. Then we will call \\(x_{(\\alpha)}\\) the \\(\\alpha\\)th (population) quantile of \\(X\\). Note that any normal distribution has this uniqueness property. If we consider a standard normal \\(Z \\sim N(0, 1)\\), then some well-known quantiles are:\n\n\\(z_{(0.5)} = 0\\) (the median, )\n\\(z_{(0.05)} = -1.645\\) and \\(z_{(0.95)} = 1.645\\)\n\\(z_{(0.025)} = -1.96\\) and \\(z_{(0.975)} = 1.96\\)\n\nWe call the 0.25th, 0.5th, 0.75th quantiles the first, the second, and the third quartiles, respectively. The quartiles divide our data into 4 equal parts.\nNow suppose \\(X \\sim N (\\mu, \\sigma^{2})\\). By standardizing to \\(Z \\sim N(0, 1)\\), we obtain \\[\n\\alpha = \\Pr \\left( X \\leqslant x_{(\\alpha)} \\right) = \\Pr \\left( \\frac{X - \\mu}{ \\sigma} \\leqslant \\frac{x_{(\\alpha)} - \\mu}{\\sigma} \\right) = \\Pr \\left( Z \\leqslant \\frac{x_{(\\alpha)} - \\mu}{ \\sigma} \\right) .\n\\]\nWe also have \\(\\alpha = \\Pr (Z \\leqslant z_{(\\alpha)} )\\) by definition. Thus, %from the uniqueness property of the \\(N (0, 1)\\), it follows that \\[\nz_{(\\alpha)} = \\frac{x_{(\\alpha)} - \\mu}{ \\sigma} ~~~~ \\mbox{and hence} ~~~~ x_{(\\alpha)} = \\sigma z_{(\\alpha)} + \\mu.\n\\]\nThus, if \\(X\\) is truly normal, a plot of the quantiles of \\(X\\) vs. the quantiles of the standard normal distribution should yield a straight line. A plot of the quantiles of \\(X\\) vs. the quantiles of \\(Z\\) is called a Q-Q plot.\nEstimating quantiles from data Let \\(X_{1}, \\ldots, X_{n}\\) be a sequence of observations. Ideally, \\(X_{1}, \\ldots, X_{n}\\) should represent i.i.d. observations but we will be happy if preliminary tests indicate that they are homoscedastic and uncorrelated (see the previous sections). We order them from the smallest to the largest and indicate this using the notation \\[\nX_{(1/n)} < X_{(2/n)} < X_{(3/n)} < \\ldots < X_{\\left((n - 1)/n\\right)} < X_{(n/n)}.\n\\]\nThe above ordering assumes no ties, but ties can be quite common in data, even continuous data, because of rounding. As long as the proportion of ties is small, this method can be used.\nNote that the proportion of observations less than or equal to \\(X_{(k/n)}\\) is exactly \\(k/n\\). Hence \\(X_{(k/n)}\\), called the \\(k\\)th {}, is an estimate of the population quantile \\(x_{(k/n)}\\).\nThe normal Q-Q plot is obtained by plotting the sample quantiles vs. the quantiles of the standard normal distribution. The base-R function qqnorm() produces a normal Q-Q plot of data and the function qqline() adds a line that passes through the first and third quartiles. The R package ggplot2 has analogous functions ggplot2::stat_qq() and ggplot2::stat_qq_line(). The R package car also draws Q-Q plots and adds a point-wise confidence envelope with its function car::qqPlot().\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Dishwasher residuals normal Q-Q plot\n\n\n\nFigure 1.5 shows the Q-Q plots of the residuals from the dishwashers example and the simulated normal data with the same mean and standard deviation.\n\n\nCode\npar(mar = c(4, 5, 1, 1) + 0.1, mgp = c(3, 1, 0), mfrow = c(1, 2))\npar(pty = \"m\")\ncar::qqPlot(x, las = 1, id = FALSE,\n    xlab = \"Standard normal quantiles\", \n    main = \"Random normal values\")\ncar::qqPlot(mod1$residuals, las = 1, id = FALSE,\n    xlab = \"Standard normal quantiles\", \n    main = \"Model residuals\")\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.5: Normal Q-Q plots of the normally distributed simulated values \\(x_t\\) and the dishwasher residuals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough visually appealing, these graphical methods do not provide objective criteria to determine the normality of variables.\nShapiro–Wilk normality test\nOne of the most popular numerical methods for assessing normality is the Shapiro–Wilk (SW) test:\n\n\\(H_0\\): the sample data come from a normally distributed population;\n\\(H_1\\): the population is not normally distributed).\n\nThe SW test is the ratio of the best estimator of the variance to the usual corrected sum of squares estimator of the variance. It has been originally constructed by considering the regression of ordered sample values on corresponding expected normal order statistics. The SW statistic is given by \\[\n\\mbox{SW} = \\frac{\\left(\\sum a_{i} x_{(i)} \\right)^{2}}{\\sum \\left(x_{i} - \\bar{x} \\right)^{2}},\n\\] where \\(x_{(i)}\\) are the ordered sample values (\\(x_{(1)}\\) is the smallest) and the \\(a_{i}\\) are constants generated from the means, variances and covariances of the order statistics of a sample of size \\(n\\) from a normal distribution. The SW statistics lies between 0 and 1. If the SW statistic is close to 1, this indicates normality of the data. The SW statistic requires the sample size \\(n\\) to be between 7 and 2000.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Dishwasher residuals normality test\n\n\n\nBased on the \\(p\\)-values below, we cannot reject the null hypothesis of normality in both cases.\n\n\nCode\nshapiro.test(x)\n\n\n#> \n#>  Shapiro-Wilk normality test\n#> \n#> data:  x\n#> W = 0.9, p-value = 0.08\n\n\nCode\nshapiro.test(mod1$residuals)\n\n\n#> \n#>  Shapiro-Wilk normality test\n#> \n#> data:  mod1$residuals\n#> W = 1, p-value = 0.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.1.4 Summary of the simple linear regression residual diagnostics\n\nThe residuals do not have a constant mean.\nThe residuals seem to have a constant variance.\nThe residuals are positively correlated.\nThe residuals look normally distributed (but the SW statistic might be affected by serial correlation of the residuals)."

    "text": "1.2 Multiple linear regression\nHere we consider a case of \\(p\\) explanatory variables \\[\nY_{t} = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1} X_{t,1} + \\ldots + \\beta_{p} X_{t,p} + \\epsilon_{t} \\quad (t = 1,\\ldots,n).\n\\]\nThis can be expressed more compactly in a matrix notation as \\[\n\\boldsymbol{Y} = \\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{\\beta} + \\boldsymbol{\\epsilon},\n\\] where \\(\\boldsymbol{Y} = (Y_{1}, \\ldots, Y_{n})^{\\top}\\), \\(\\boldsymbol{\\beta} = (\\beta_{0} , \\ldots, \\beta_{p})^{\\top}\\), \\(\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon} = (\\epsilon_{1} , \\ldots, \\epsilon_{n})^{\\top}\\); \\(\\boldsymbol{X}\\) is an \\(n \\times (p + 1)\\) design matrix \\[\n\\boldsymbol{X} = \\left(\n\\begin{array}{cccc}\n1 & X_{1,1} & \\ldots & X_{1,p} \\\\\n1 & X_{2,1}& \\ldots & X_{2,p} \\\\\n\\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\n1 & X_{n,1}& \\ldots & X_{n,p}\n\\end{array}\n\\right).\n\\]\nHere the historical data for the dependent variable consist of the observations \\(Y_{1}, \\ldots, Y_{n}\\); the historical data for the independent variables consist of the observations in the matrix \\(\\boldsymbol{X}\\).\nMinimizing \\(SSE =(\\boldsymbol{Y} - \\boldsymbol{X} \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}})^{\\top} (\\boldsymbol{Y} - \\boldsymbol{X} \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}})\\) yields the least squares solutions \\[\n\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}} = \\left( \\boldsymbol{X}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{X} \\right)^{-1} \\boldsymbol{X}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{Y}\n\\] for non-singular \\(\\boldsymbol{X}^{\\top}\\boldsymbol{X}\\).\nThe forecast of a future value \\(Y_{t}\\) is then given by \\[\n\\hat{Y}_{t} = \\boldsymbol{x}^{\\top}_{t} \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}},\n\\] where \\(\\boldsymbol{x}_{t}\\) is a (column) vector at time \\(t\\).\nUnder the OLS assumptions (recall them) we obtain \\[\n\\mathrm{var} \\left( \\hat{\\beta}_{j} \\right) = \\sigma^{2} \\left( \\boldsymbol{X }^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{X} \\right)^{-1}_{jj},\n\\] where the \\(\\left( \\boldsymbol{X}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{X} \\right)^{-1}_{jj}\\) denotes the \\(j\\)th diagonal element of \\(\\left( \\boldsymbol{X }^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{X} \\right)^{-1}\\).\nThis yields \\[\ns.e. \\left( \\hat{\\beta}_{j} \\right) = \\hat{\\sigma} \\sqrt{ \\left( \\boldsymbol{X }^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{X} \\right)^{-1}_{jj}}.\n\\]\nNote that here the degrees of freedom (d.f.) are \\(n - (p + 1) = n - p - 1\\). (The number of estimated parameters for the independent variables is \\(p\\), plus one for the intercept, i.e., \\(p + 1\\).)\nUnder the OLS assumptions, a \\(100(1 - \\alpha)\\)% confidence interval for the parameter \\(\\beta_{j}\\) (\\(j = 0, 1, \\ldots, p\\)) is given by \\[\n\\begin{split}\n\\hat{\\beta}_{j} &\\pm t_{\\alpha / 2, n - (p+1)} s.e.\\left( \\hat{\\beta}_{j} \\right) \\text{ or} \\\\\n\\hat{\\beta}_{j} &\\pm t_{\\alpha / 2, n - (p+1)} \\hat{\\sigma} \\sqrt{\\left( \\boldsymbol{X}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{X} \\right)^{-1}_{jj}}.\n\\end{split}\n\\tag{1.2}\\]\nTypically, \\(s.e.(\\hat{\\beta}_{j})\\) is available directly from the R output, so Equation 1.2 is calculated automatically.\nUnder the OLS assumptions it can be shown that \\[\n\\mathrm{var} \\left( Y_{t} - \\hat{Y}_{t} \\right) = \\sigma^{2} \\left( \\boldsymbol{x}^{\\top}_{t} \\left( \\boldsymbol{X}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{X} \\right)^{- 1} \\boldsymbol{x}_{t} + 1 \\right),\n\\] yielding a \\(100(1 - \\alpha)\\)% prediction interval for \\(Y_{t}\\): \\[\n\\boldsymbol{x}^{\\top}_{t} \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}} \\pm t_{\\alpha / 2, n-(p+1)} \\hat{\\sigma} \\sqrt{ \\boldsymbol{x}^{\\top}_{t} \\left( \\boldsymbol{X}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{X} \\right)^{-1}\\boldsymbol{x}_{t} + 1}.\n\\]\nWe usually never perform these calculations by hand and will use the corresponding software functions, e.g., using the function predict(), see an example code below.\nWhat else can we get from the regression output?\nAs in SLR, we will look for the \\(t\\)-statistics and \\(p\\)-values to get an idea about statistical significance of each of the predictors \\(X_{t,1}, X_{t,2}, \\ldots, X_{t,p}\\). The confidence intervals constructed above correspond to individual tests of hypothesis about a parameter, i.e., \\(H_{0}\\): \\(\\beta_{j} = 0\\) vs. \\(H_{1}\\): \\(\\beta_{j} \\neq 0\\).\nWe can also make use of the \\(F\\)-test. The \\(F\\)-test considers all parameters (other than the intercept \\(\\beta_{0}\\)) simultaneously, testing \\[\n\\begin{split}\nH_{0}{:} ~ \\beta_{1} &= \\ldots = \\beta_{p} = 0 ~~~ \\text{vs.} \\\\\nH_{1}{:} ~ \\beta_{j} &\\neq 0 ~~~ \\mbox{for at least one} ~~~ j \\in \\{1, \\ldots, p \\}.\n\\end{split}\n\\]\nFormally, \\(F_{\\rm{obs}} = \\rm{MSR/MSE}\\) (the ratio of the mean square due to regression and the mean square due to stochastic errors).\nWe reject \\(H_{0}\\) when \\(F_{\\rm{obs}}\\) is too large relative to a cut-off point determined by the degrees of freedom of the \\(F\\)-distribution. The \\(p\\)-value for this \\(F\\)-test is provided in the lm() output. Rejecting \\(H_{0}\\) is equivalent to stating that the model has some explanatory value within the range of the data set, meaning that changes in at least some of the explanatory \\(X\\)-variables correlate to changes in the average value of \\(Y\\).\nRecall that \\[\n\\begin{split}\n\\mathrm{SST} &= \\sum_{i=1}^n(Y_t-\\overline{Y})^2= \\mathrm{SSR} + \\mathrm{SSE},\\\\\n\\mathrm{SSE} &=\\sum_{t=1}^n(Y_t-\\hat{\\beta}_0 - \\hat{\\beta}_1 X_{t,1}-\\ldots- \\hat{\\beta}_p X_{t,p})\n\\end{split}\n\\] and, hence, \\[\n\\rm{SSR}=\\rm{SST}-\\rm{SSE}.\n\\]\nTo conclude that the model has a reasonable fit, however, we would additionally like to see a high \\(R^{2}\\) value, where \\[\nR^{2} = \\rm{SSR/SST}\n\\] is the proportion of the total sum of squares explained by regression.\nSmall \\(R^{2}\\) means that the stochastic fluctuations around the regression line (or prediction equation) are large, making the prediction task difficult, even though there may be a genuine explanatory relationship between the average value \\(\\mathrm{E}(Y)\\) and some of the \\(X\\)-variables.\nAnother criterion to judge about aptness of the obtained model is the adjusted \\(R^2\\): \\[\nR^2_{adj}=1-\\frac{n-1}{n-p}\\left( 1-R^2 \\right).\n\\]\nUnlike \\(R^2\\) itself, \\(R^2_{adj}\\) need not increase if an arbitrary (even useless) predictor is added to the model because of the correction \\((n-1)/(n-p)\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe intercept \\(\\beta_{0}\\) is not included in the \\(F\\)-test because there is no explanatory variable associated with it. In other words, \\(\\beta_{0}\\) does not contribute to the regression part of the model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Dishwasher shipments multiple linear regression\n\n\n\nLet us now extend the SLR model that we considered previously and include another potential predictor, the durable goods expenditures (billion of 1972 dollars). The goal is to build a model to predict the unit factory shipments of dishwashers (DISH) vs. private residential investment (RES) and durable goods expenditures (DUR) using a multiple linear regression model (MLR): \\[\nY_{t} = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1} X_{t,1} + \\beta_{2} X_{t,2} + \\epsilon_t,\n\\] where \\(X_{t,1}\\) is the private residential investment RES; \\(X_{t,2}\\) is the durable goods expenditures DUR.\nNow we apply the OLS method to estimate the coefficients \\(\\beta_{0}\\), \\(\\beta_{1}\\), and \\(\\beta_{2}\\) using the function lm().\n\n\nCode\nmod2 <- lm(DISH ~ RES + DUR, data = D)\nsummary(mod2)\n\n\n#> \n#> Call:\n#> lm(formula = DISH ~ RES + DUR, data = D)\n#> \n#> Residuals:\n#>    Min     1Q Median     3Q    Max \n#> -643.9 -263.2  -22.1  190.2  920.0 \n#> \n#> Coefficients:\n#>             Estimate Std.

    "text": "1.3 Conclusion\nWe have recalled the standard assumptions about residuals of linear regression models. Remember that there are some other assumptions (e.g., about linear independence of predictors) that must be verified. Refer to the reading materials for a complete list.\nThe methods we have used to test the homogeneity of residuals included various residual plots. The normality of residuals can be assessed using histograms or Q-Q plots and statistical tests such as Shapiro–Wilk normality test.\nThe use of time series in regression presents additional ways to assess patterns in the regression residuals. A plot of residuals vs. time is assessed for homogeneity and absence of trends. Less obvious patterns, such as autocorrelation, can be tested with parametric and nonparametric tests, such as the Durbin–Watson and runs tests.\nThe goal of the statistical techniques we will learn is to model or extract as much information from time series (including the autocorrelation of regression residuals) as possible, such that the remaining series are completely random."

    "text": "2.1 Time series and its components\nA time series is a set of observations \\(Y_t\\), each one being recorded at a specific time \\(t\\) (Brockwell and Davis 2002). The index \\(t\\) will typically refer to some standard unit of time, e.g., seconds, hours, days, weeks, months, or years.\nA time series is a collection of observations made sequentially through time (Chatfield 2000).\nA stochastic process is sequence of random variables \\(Y_t\\), \\(t = 1, 2, \\ldots\\) indexed by time \\(t\\), can be written as \\(\\{Y_t, t\\in[1,T]\\}\\). A time series is a realization of a stochastic process.\nWe shall frequently use the term time series to mean both the data and the process.\n\n\nCode\np <- forecast::autoplot(TSstudio::Michigan_CS) + \n    xlab(\"\") + \n    ylab(\"Index\") + \n    theme_light()\nplotly::ggplotly(p)\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.1: Monthly index of consumer sentiment, University of Michigan Consumer Survey (1966:Q1 = 100).\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot2::autoplot(JohnsonJohnson) + \n    xlab(\"\") + \n    ylab(\"Earnings per share (USD)\") + \n    theme_light()\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.2: Quarterly earnings (dollars) per Johnson & Johnson share, 1960–1980.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot2::autoplot(MASS::accdeaths) + \n    xlab(\"\") + \n    ylab(\"Number of accidental deaths\") + \n    theme_light()\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.3: Monthly totals of accidental deaths in the USA, 1973–1978.\n\n\n\n\nIn this course, we will be interested in constructing time series models to learn more about their properties and to forecast (predict) future values of \\(Y_t\\), i.e., values of \\(Y_t\\) for \\(t\\) beyond the end of the data set. Typically, we will use the historical data (or some appropriate subset of it) to build our forecasting models.\n\n2.1.1 Decomposition of time series\nA time series can generally be expressed as a sum or product of four distinct components: \\[\nY_t = M_t + S_t + C_t + \\epsilon_t\n\\] or \\[\nY_t = M_t \\cdot S_t \\cdot C_t \\cdot \\epsilon_t,\n\\] where\n\n\\(M_t\\) is the trend, representing the average change (change in the mean) in the time series over time. Examples of trends are:\n\\(M_t = \\beta_0\\) (constant over time, we usually refer to this case as ‘no trend’);\n\\(M_t = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1t\\) (linear increase or decrease over time);\n \\(M_t = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1t + \\beta_2t^2\\) (quadratic over time).\n\n\\(S_t\\) represents regular periodic fluctuations (a.k.a. seasonality) in the time series. \\(S_t\\) has the property that it is not constant but there exists an integer \\(m \\geqslant 2\\) and scaling factors \\(\\lambda_k > 0\\) such that \\(S_{t+km} = \\lambda_kS_t\\) for \\(1 \\leqslant t \\leqslant m\\) and each \\(k \\geqslant 1\\). The smallest such \\(m\\) is called the period. Periodic time series are quite common and include seasonal variability (period of 1 year), diurnal (period 24 hours), and other cycles such as tides (period 12 hours 25 minutes). This component can be modeled using sinusoidal functions or indicator variables.\n\\(C_t\\) represents irregular cyclical fluctuations, i.e., sinusoidal-type movements that are of irregular length and are not as predictable as the seasonal component, e.g., El Ni~{n}o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and macroeconomic business cycles. We do not explicitly model \\(C_t\\) in this course.\n\\(\\epsilon_t\\) is the residual or error and represents the remaining unexplained variation in \\(Y_t\\). In other words, it is a random or stochastic component.\n\nFigure 2.4 illustrates an automatic decomposition, however, because the user has too little control of how the decomposition is done, this function is not recommended for use in your analysis. We will talk about the alternatives in the next lecture.\n\n\nCode\nbirths <- scan(\"http://robjhyndman.com/tsdldata/data/nybirths.dat\")\nbirths <- ts(births, frequency = 12, start = c(1946, 1))\nggplot2::autoplot(decompose(births))  + \n    theme_light()\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.4: Time-series decomposition of monthly number of births in New York City (thousands), 1946–1959.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1.2 General approach to time series modeling\n\nPlot the series and examine the main features of the graph, checking whether there is\n\na trend,\na seasonal or other periodic component,\nany apparent sharp changes in behavior,\nany outlying observations.\n\nRemove the trend and periodic components to get stationary residuals (this step is called detrending and deseasonalizing). Broadly speaking, a time series is said to be stationary if there is\n\nno systematic change in the mean (no trend);\nno systematic change in the variance, and\nno strictly periodic variations.\n\nChoose a model to fit the residuals, making use of various sample statistics, including the sample autocorrelation function (ACF).\nForecast the residuals and then invert the transformations to arrive at forecasts of the original series.\n\nThere are two general classes of forecasting models.\nUnivariate time series models include different types of exponential smoothing, trend models, autoregressive models, etc. The characteristic feature of these models is that we need only one time series to start with (\\(Y_t\\)), then we can build a regression of this time series over time (\\(Y_t \\sim t\\)) for estimating trend or, for example, an autoregressive model (‘auto’ \\(=\\) self). In autoregressive approach, the current value \\(Y_t\\) is modeled as a function of the past values: \\[\nY_t = f(Y_{t-1}, Y_{t-2}, \\ldots, Y_{t-p}) + \\epsilon_t,\n\\tag{2.1}\\] while a linear autoregressive model has the form (assume that function \\(f(\\cdot)\\) is a linear parametric function, with parameters \\(\\phi_0, \\phi_1, \\ldots, \\phi_p\\)): \\[\nY_t = \\phi_0 + \\phi_1 Y_{t-1} + \\phi_2 Y_{t-2} + \\ldots +\\phi_p Y_{t-p} + \\epsilon_t.\n\\]\nMultivariate models involve additional covariates (a.k.a. regressors, predictors, or independent variables) \\(X_{1,t}, X_{2,t}, \\ldots, X_{k,t}\\). A multivariate time series model can be as simple as a multiple regression \\[\nY_t = f(X_{1,t}, X_{2,t}, \\ldots, X_{k,t}) + \\epsilon_t,\n\\] or involve autoregressive components of the response (and predictors): \\[\n\\begin{split}\nY_t = f(&X_{1,t}, X_{2,t}, \\ldots, X_{k,t}, \\\\\n&X_{1,t-1}, X_{1,t-2}, \\ldots, X_{1,t-q1}, \\\\\n&\\cdots\\\\\n&X_{k,t-1}, X_{k,t-2}, \\ldots, X_{k,t-qk}, \\\\\n&Y_{t-1}, Y_{t-2}, \\ldots, Y_{t-p}) + \\epsilon_t,\n\\end{split}\n\\tag{2.2}\\] where \\(p\\), \\(q1, \\ldots, qk\\) are the lags. You can start your analysis with many variables and build a forecasting model as complex as Equation 2.2, but remember that a simpler univariate model may also work well. You should create an appropriate univariate model (like in Equation 2.1) to serve as a baseline, then compare the models’ performance on some out-of-sample data, as described in Section 2.1.3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Identify the time-series components in these plots\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot2::autoplot(sunspots) + \n    xlab(\"\") + \n    ylab(\"Sunspot number\") + \n    theme_light()\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.5: Monthly mean relative sunspot numbers from 1749 to 1983.

The mean and variance are constant overall (nor increasing or decreasing), but there are clusters of volatility.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1.3 Model comparison\nHow do we compare forecasting models to decide which one is better? We will look at various ways of choosing between models as the course progresses, but the most obvious answer is to see which one is better at predicting.\nSuppose we have used the data \\(Y_1, \\ldots, Y_n\\) to build \\(M\\) forecasting models \\(\\hat{Y}^{(m)}_t\\) (\\(m = 1,\\ldots,M\\)) and we now obtain future observation \\(Y_{n+1}, \\ldots, Y_{n+k}\\) that were not used to fit the models (also called out-of-sample data, or after-sample, or testing set; \\(k\\) is the size of this set). The difference \\(Y_t - \\hat{Y}^{(m)}_t\\) is the forecast (or prediction) error at time \\(t\\) for the \\(m\\)th model. For each model, compute the prediction mean square error (PMSE) \\[\nPMSE_m = k^{-1}\\sum_{t=n+1}^{n+k}\\left(Y_t - \\hat{Y}^{(m)}_t\\right)^2\n\\tag{2.3}\\] and prediction mean absolute error (PMAE) \\[\nPMAE_m = k^{-1}\\sum_{t=n+1}^{n+k}\\left|Y_t - \\hat{Y}^{(m)}_t\\right|\n\\tag{2.4}\\] and, similarly, prediction root mean square error (PRMSE; \\(PRMSE = \\sqrt{PMSE}\\)), prediction mean absolute percentage error (PMAPE, if \\(Y_t \\neq 0\\) in the testing period), etc. We choose the model with the smallest error.\nOne obvious drawback to the above method is that it requires you to wait for future observations in order to compare models. A way around this to take the historical dataset \\(Y_1, \\ldots, Y_n\\) and split it into a training set \\(Y_1, \\ldots, Y_k\\) and a testing set \\(Y_{k+1}, \\ldots, Y_n\\), where \\((n - k)\\ll k\\), i.e., most of the data goes into the training set.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThis scheme of splitting time series into the testing and training sets is a simple form of cross-validation. Not all forms of cross-validation are applicable to time series due to the usual temporal dependence in time series data. We need to select cross-validation techniques that can accommodate such dependence. Usually, it implies selecting data for validation not at random but in consecutive chunks (periods) and, ideally, with testing or validation periods being after the training period.\n\n\nForecasting models are then built using only the training set, and used to ‘forecast’ values from the testing set. Sometimes it is called an out-of-sample forecast, because we predict values for the times we have not used for the model specification and estimation. The testing set is used as a set of future observations to compute the PMSE. The PMSE and other errors are computed for each model over the testing set, and then compared to see errors for which models are smaller.\nIf two models produce approximately the same errors, we choose the model that is simpler (involves fewer variables). This is called the law of parsimony.\nThe above error measures (PMSE, PRMSE, PMAE, etc.) compare observed and forecasted data points, hence, are measures of accuracy of the point forecasts. Another way of comparing models could be based on the quality of their interval forecasts, i.e., by assessing how good the prediction intervals are. To assess quality of interval forecasts, one may start by computing the empirical coverage (proportion of data points in the testing set that are within – covered by – corresponding prediction intervals for given confidence \\(C\\), e.g., 95%) and average interval width. Prediction intervals are well-calibrated if empirical coverage is close to \\(C\\) (more important) while intervals are not too wide (less important).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nTo select the best coverage, one can calculate the absolute differences between the nominal coverage \\(C\\) and each empirical coverage \\(\\hat{C}_m\\): \\[\n\\Delta_m = |C - \\hat{C}_m|.\n\\] Hence, we select the model with the smallest \\(\\Delta_m\\), not the largest coverage \\(C_m\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIt is possible to obtain different prediction intervals from the same model. For example, you can calculate prediction intervals based on normal and bootstrapped distributions. In this case, point forecasts are the same, but interval forecasts differ.\n\n\nWe may compare a great number of models using the training set, and choose the best one (with smallest errors), however, it would be unfair to use the out-of-sample errors from testing set for demonstrating the model performance because this part of sample was used to select the model. Thus, it is advisable to have one more chunk of the same time series that was not used for model specification, estimation, or selection. Errors of the selected model on this validation set will be closer to the true (genuine) out-of-sample errors and can be used to improve coverage of true out-of-sample forecasts when the model is finally deployed."

Loosely speaking, a time series \\(X_t\\) (\\(t=0,\\pm 1, \\ldots\\)) is stationary if it has statistical properties similar to those of the time shifted series \\(X_{t+h}\\) for each integer \\(h\\).\nLet \\(X_t\\) be a time series with \\(\\mathrm{E}(X^2_t)<\\infty\\), then the mean function of \\(X_t\\) is \\[\n\\mu_X(t)=\\mathrm{E}(X_t).\n\\]\nThe autocovariance function of \\(X_t\\) is \\[\n\\gamma_X(r,s) = \\mathrm{cov}(X_r,X_s) = \\mathrm{E}[(X_r-\\mu_X(r))(X_s-\\mu_X(s))]\n\\tag{2.5}\\] for all integer \\(r\\) and \\(s\\).\nWeak stationarity\n\\(X_t\\) is (weakly) stationary if \\(\\mu_X(t)\\) is independent of \\(t\\), and \\(\\gamma_X(t+h,t)\\) is independent of \\(t\\) for each \\(h\\) (consider only the first two moments): \\[\n\\begin{split}\n\\mathrm{E}(X_t) &= \\mu, \\\\\n\\mathrm{cov}(X_t, X_{t+h}) &= \\gamma_X(h) < \\infty.\n\\end{split}\n\\tag{2.6}\\]\nStrong stationarity\n\\(X_t\\) is strictly stationary if (\\(X_1, \\ldots, X_n\\)) and (\\(X_{1+h}, \\ldots, X_{n+h}\\)) have the same joint distribution (consider all moments).\nStrictly stationary \\(X_t\\) with finite variance \\(\\mathrm{E}(X_t^2) <\\infty\\) for all \\(t\\) is also weakly stationary.\nIf \\(X_t\\) is a Gaussian process, then strict and weak stationarity are equivalent (i.e., one form of stationarity implies the other).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIn applications, it is usually very difficult if not impossible to verify strict stationarity. So in the vast majority of cases we are satisfied with the weak stationarity. Moreover, we usually omit the word ‘weak’ and simply talk about stationarity (but have the weak stationary in mind).\n\n\nIn view of the second condition of weak stationarity in Equation 2.6, we can write for stationary(!) time series the autocovariance function (ACVF) for the lag \\(h\\): \\[\n\\gamma_X(h)= \\gamma_X(t+h,t) = \\mathrm{cov}(X_{t+h},X_t)\n\\] and the autocorrelation function (ACF), which is the normalized autocovariance: \\[\n\\rho_X(h)=\\frac{\\gamma_X(h)}{\\gamma_X(0)}=\\mathrm{cor}(X_{t+h},X_t).\n\\]\nThe sample autocovariance function is defined as: \\[\n\\hat{\\gamma}_X(h)= n^{-1}\\sum_{t=1}^{n-k}(x_{t+h}- \\bar{x})(x_t - \\bar{x}),\n\\] with \\(\\hat{\\gamma}_X(h) = \\hat{\\gamma}_X(-h)\\) for \\(h = 0,1,\\ldots, n-1\\). In R, use acf(X, type = \"covariance\").\nThe sample autocorrelation function is defined as (in R, use acf(X)): \\[\n\\hat{\\rho}_X(h)=\\frac{\\hat{\\gamma}_X(h)}{\\hat{\\gamma}_X(0)}.\n\\]\n\n2.3.1 Properties of autocovariance and autocorrelation functions\n\nLinearity: if \\(\\mathrm{E}(X^2) < \\infty\\), \\(\\mathrm{E}(Y^2) < \\infty\\), \\(\\mathrm{E}(Z^2) < \\infty\\) and \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are any real constants, then \\[\n\\mathrm{cov}(aX + bY + c, Z) = a\\mathrm{cov}(X,Z) + b\\mathrm{cov}(Y,Z).\n\\]\n\\(\\gamma(0) \\geqslant 0\\).\n\\(|\\gamma(h)| \\leqslant \\gamma(0)\\) for all \\(h\\).\n\\(\\gamma(\\cdot)\\) is even: \\(\\gamma(h) = \\gamma(-h)\\) for all \\(h\\).\n\\(\\gamma(\\cdot)\\) is non-negative definite: \\[\n\\sum_{i,j=1}^na_i \\gamma(i-j)a_j\\geqslant 0,\n\\] for all positive integers \\(n\\) and vectors \\(\\boldsymbol{a} = (a_1, \\ldots, a_n)^{\\top}\\) with real-valued elements \\(a_i\\).\nThe autocorrelation function \\(\\rho(\\cdot)\\) has all the properties of autocovariance function plus \\(\\rho(0)=1\\).\nFor i.i.d. noise with finite variance, the sample autocorrelations \\(\\hat{\\rho}(h)\\), \\(h>0\\), are approximately \\(N(0,1/n)\\) for large sample size \\(n\\). Hence, approximately 95% of the sample autocorrelations should fall between the bounds \\(\\pm1.96/\\sqrt{n}\\) (1.96 is the 0.975th quantile of the standard normal distribution) – this is the bound automatically drawn by the R function acf(). Note that in R as a rule of thumb the default maximal lag is \\(10 \\log_{10}(n)\\), and the same \\(n\\) is used for the confidence bounds at all lags (however, in reality, samples of different sizes are used for each lag).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Compare ACFs of time series with and without a strong trend\n\n\n\nThe time series plot of births in Figure 2.11 shows a trend. The time series is not stationary. Thus, the calculated ACF is useless (it is calculated under the assumption of stationarity), but we notice some periodicity in the ACF – it is a sign of periodicity in the time series itself (seasonality). Need to remove the trend (and seasonality) and repeat the ACF analysis.\nCompare with the plots for accidental deaths in Figure 2.12.\n\n\nCode\np1 <- ggplot2::autoplot(births) + \n    xlab(\"\") +\n    ylab(\"Number of births (thousands)\") +\n    theme_light()\np2 <- forecast::ggAcf(births) + \n    ggtitle(\"\") +\n    xlab(\"Lag (months)\") + \n    theme_light()\np1 + p2 +\n    plot_annotation(tag_levels = 'A')\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.11: Time series plot and sample ACF of monthly number of births in New York City, 1946–1959.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\np1 <- ggplot2::autoplot(MASS::accdeaths) + \n    xlab(\"\") +\n    ylab(\"Number of accidental deaths\") +\n    theme_light()\np2 <- forecast::ggAcf(MASS::accdeaths) + \n    ggtitle(\"\") +\n    xlab(\"Lag (months)\") + \n    theme_light()\np1 + p2 +\n    plot_annotation(tag_levels = 'A')\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.12: Time series plot and sample ACF of monthly totals of accidental deaths in the USA, 1973–1978.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIn base-R plots, the lags in ACF plots are measured in the number of periods. The period information (or frequency, i.e., the number of observation per period) is saved in the format ts in R:\n\n\nCode\nis.ts(births)\n\n\n#> [1] TRUE\n\n\nCode\nfrequency(births)\n\n\n#> [1] 12\n\n\nYou don’t have to convert data to this format. If you plot ACF of just a vector without these attributes, the values are the same, just the labels on the horizontal axis are different (Figure 2.13). For monthly data, as in the example here, frequency is 12. Hence, here ACF at lag 0.5 (Figure 2.13 A) means autocorrelation with the lag \\(h=6\\) months (Figure 2.13 B); lag 1 (Figure 2.13 A) corresponds to one whole period of \\(h=12\\) months (Figure 2.13 B), and so on.\n\n\nCode\npar(mar = c(4, 4, 3, 1) + 0.1, mfrow = c(1, 2))\npar(pty = \"m\")\n\nacf(births, lag.max = 37, las = 1, main = \"A) Input is a ts object\")\nacf(as.numeric(births), lag.max = 37, las = 1, main = \"B) Input is a numeric vector\")\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.13: In base-R graphics, the x-axis labels in ACF plots differ depending on the input format.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe ts objects in R cannot incorporate varying periods (e.g., different number of days or weeks because of leap years), therefore, we recommend using this format only for monthly or annual data. Setting frequency = 365.25 for daily data could be an option (although not very accurate) to accommodate leap years.\nConverting to the ts format usually is not required for analysis. Most of the times we use plain numeric vectors and data frames in R.\nContributed R packages offer additional formats for time series, e.g., see packages xts and zoo."

If the variables are multivariate normal, then this definition coincides with \\(\\rho_{XY|Z} = \\mathrm{cor}(X,Y | Z)\\).\nThe partial autocorrelation function (PACF) of a stationary process, \\(X_t\\), denoted \\(\\rho_{hh}\\), for \\(h = 1,2,\\ldots\\), is \\[\n\\rho_{11} = \\mathrm{cor}(X_{t+1}, X_t) = \\rho(1)\n\\] and \\[\n\\rho_{hh} = \\mathrm{cor}(X_{t+h} - \\hat{X}_{t+h}, X_t - \\hat{X}_t), \\; h\\geqslant 2.\n\\]\nBoth \\((X_{t+h} - \\hat{X}_{t+h})\\) and \\((X_t - \\hat{X}_t)\\) are uncorrelated with \\(\\{ X_{t+1}, \\ldots, X_{t+h-1}\\}\\). The PACF, \\(\\rho_{hh}\\), is the correlation between \\(X_{t+h}\\) and \\(X_t\\) with the linear dependence of everything between them, namely \\(\\{ X_{t+1}, \\ldots, X_{t+h-1}\\}\\), on each, removed.\nTo obtain sample estimates of PACF in R, use pacf(X) or acf(X, type = \"partial\").\nCorrelation and partial correlation coefficients measure strength and direction of the relationship, changing within \\([-1, 1]\\). Percent of explained variance for the case of two variables is measured by squared correlation (r-squared; \\(R^2\\); coefficient of determination) changing within \\([0, 1]\\), so correlation of 0.2 means only 4% of variance explained by the simple linear relationship (regression). To report a partial correlation, for example, of 0.2 at lag 3, one could say something like ‘The partial autocorrelation at lag 3 (after removing influence of the intermediate lags 1 and 2) is 0.2’ (depending on the application, the correlation of 0.2 can be considered weak or moderate strength) or ‘After accounting for autocorrelation at intermediate lags 1 and 2, the linear relationship at lag 3 can explain 4% of the remaining variability.’\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: ACF and PACF of accdeaths\n\n\n\nBy plotting ACF and PACF (Figure 2.14), we observe that most of the temporal dependence (autocorrelation) in this time series is due to correlation with the immediately preceding values (see PACF at lag 1).\n\n\nCode\np1 <- forecast::ggAcf(MASS::accdeaths) + \n    ggtitle(\"\") +\n    xlab(\"Lag (months)\") + \n    theme_light()\np2 <- forecast::ggAcf(MASS::accdeaths, type = \"partial\") + \n    ggtitle(\"\") +\n    xlab(\"Lag (months)\") + \n    theme_light()\np1 + p2 +\n    plot_annotation(tag_levels = 'A')\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.14: ACF and PACF plots of the monthly accidental deaths."

For identification, we need \\(\\sum_{t=1}^m S_t = 0\\) and \\(\\mathrm{E}(\\epsilon_t)=0\\).\nOur goal is to estimate and extract \\(M_t\\) and \\(S_t\\) with a hope that the residual or noise component \\(\\epsilon_t\\) will turn out to be a stationary time series (Section 3.2–Section 3.5). Alternatively, Box–Jenkins models use difference operators repeatedly to the series \\(Y_t\\) until a stationary time series is obtained (see Section 3.6 on differencing).\nThe seasonal component is said to have constant seasonal variation if the scaling factors satisfy \\(\\lambda_{k} = 1\\) for all \\(k\\). In other words, \\(S_{t+m} = S_{t}\\) for all \\(t\\). The constant variation is an assumption of most modeling techniques we will be using in this course. Unfortunately, many real seasonal time series do not have this constancy property and it is necessary to first perform a variance-stabilizing transformation to modify the original time series into one with constant variation. To some extent this is a matter of trial-and-error, where we work from ‘weaker’ transformations to ‘stronger’ transformations as needed. Typically, power transformations are used \\(Y_{t} \\rightarrow Y^{\\lambda}_{t}\\), where \\(0 < \\lambda < 1\\) or, log or even log log transformations, e.g., \\(Y_{t} \\rightarrow \\log Y_{t}\\).\nThe log transformation of \\(Y_t\\) is convenient when we assume not an additive model as Equation 3.1 is, but a multiplicative model as \\[\nY_t = M_t \\cdot S_t \\cdot \\epsilon_t.\n\\tag{3.2}\\] When applying variance-stabilizing log transformation to Equation 3.2, we get an additive result: \\[\n\\log Y_t = \\log M_t + \\log S_t + \\log \\epsilon_t,\n\\tag{3.3}\\] which is now similar to Equation 3.1. We will refer to Equation 3.1 as additive seasonality, and to Equation 3.2 as multiplicative seasonality. Only few methods can deal with the multiplicative case Equation 3.2 directly; most methods we consider in this course will require us to apply a transformation as in Equation 3.3.\nIn the following sections, we consider methods for estimation and elimination of \\(M_t\\) (for non-seasonal data, when \\(S_t = 0\\) in the additive case Equation 3.1 or \\(S_t = 1\\) in the multiplicative case Equation 3.2) and of both \\(M_t\\) and \\(S_t\\) (for seasonal data)."

Remember that sum of \\(S_t\\) within each period is 0. Hence, to smooth out the seasonal component (and noise) and get an estimate of just \\(M_t\\), we will use a moving window \\(w\\) sized as the seasonal period \\(m\\) (more generally, \\(w = km\\), where \\(k\\in \\mathbb{N}^{+}\\), if a greater smoothness is desired). It will often lead to the window size \\(w\\) being even. For even \\(w\\), Equation 3.4 is modified as follows (we now use \\(km + 1\\) elements so the window is still centered, but the elements on the ends receive half the weight): \\[\n\\hat{M}_t = \\frac{0.5Y_{t-km/2} + Y_{t-km/2 + 1} +\\ldots+Y_{t+km/2-1} + 0.5Y_{t+km/2}}{km}.\n\\tag{3.5}\\]\nUse \\(Y_t - \\hat{M}_t\\) to estimate the seasonal component – get \\(\\hat{S}_t\\). If needed, correct the estimates to sum up to 0 in each period. Let \\(\\hat{S}^*_t\\) be the corrected values.\nUse deseasonalized data \\(Y_t - \\hat{S}^*_t\\) to re-estimate the trend. Let \\(\\hat{M}^*_t\\) be the corrected trend estimate.\nThe estimated random noise is then: \\(\\hat{\\epsilon}_t = Y_t - \\hat{M}^*_t - \\hat{S}^*_t\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nFor the multiplicative case, replace subtractions with divisions, let the product of \\(\\hat{S}^*_t\\) be 1 within each seasonal period.\n\n\nThe above algorithm is implemented in stats::decompose(), but its main disadvantage is in the centered moving average filter used to estimate \\(M_t\\) that does not produce smoothed values for the most recent observations. We can elaborate this algorithm, first, by using different estimators for \\(M_t\\); second, by also replacing estimators for \\(S_t\\) (e.g., see the next section).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Secchi automatic (simple moving average-based) decomposition\n\n\n\nConsider monthly data of Secchi disk depth measured at the station CB1.1 in Chesapeake Bay (Figure 3.4), with the decomposition in Figure 3.5.\n\n\nCode\nload(\"./data/Secchi_CB1.1.RData\")\npSecchi <- ggplot2::autoplot(Secchi, col = \"grey50\") + \n    xlab(\"Year\") + \n    ylab(\"Secchi depth (m)\") + \n    theme_light()\np2 <- forecast::ggAcf(Secchi) + \n    ggtitle(\"\") +\n    xlab(\"Lag (months)\") + \n    theme_light()\npSecchi + p2 +\n    plot_annotation(tag_levels = 'A')\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.4: Monthly average Secchi disk depth at station CB1.1 and its ACF.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot2::autoplot(stats::decompose(Secchi))  + \n    theme_light()\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.5: Trend-seasonal decomposition of monthly average Secchi disk depth at station CB1.1."

    "text": "3.3 Lowess smoothing\nOne of the alternatives for estimating trends \\(M_t\\) is locally weighted regression (shortened as ‘lowess’ or ‘loess’) (Cleveland 1979). We can apply lowess as a regression of \\(Y_t\\) on time, for example, using the algorithm outlined by Berk (2016):\n\nChoose the smoothing parameter such as bandwidth, \\(f\\), which is a proportion between 0 and 1.\nChoose a point \\(t_0\\) and its \\(w = f n\\) nearest points on the time axis.\nFor these \\(w\\) nearest neighbor points, compute a weighted least squares regression line for \\(Y_t\\) on \\(t\\). The coefficients \\(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\) of such regression are estimated by minimizing the residual sum of squares \\[\n\\text{RSS}^*(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}) = (\\boldsymbol{Y}^* - \\boldsymbol{X}^* \\boldsymbol{\\beta})^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{W}^* (\\boldsymbol{Y}^* - \\boldsymbol{X}^* \\boldsymbol{\\beta}),\n\\] where the asterisk indicates that only the observations in the window are included. The regressor matrix \\(\\boldsymbol{X}^*\\) can contain polynomial terms of time, \\(t\\). The \\(\\boldsymbol{W}^*\\) is a diagonal matrix conforming to \\(\\boldsymbol{X}^*\\), with diagonal elements being a function of distance from \\(t_0\\) (observations closer to \\(t_0\\) receive higher weights).\nCalculate the fitted value \\(\\tilde{Y}_t\\) for that single \\(t_0\\).\nRepeat Steps 2–4 for each \\(t_0 = 1,\\ldots,n\\).\n\nBy selecting large bandwidth \\(f\\) in the lowess algorithm, we can obtain greater smoothing (see Figure 3.6).\n\n\nCode\ndata(WWWusage)\nps <- lapply(c(0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.75), function(w){\n    ggplot2::autoplot(WWWusage, colour = \"grey50\")  + \n        ggtitle(paste0(\"span = \", w)) +\n        theme_light() + \n        geom_smooth(method = \"loess\", span = w, se = FALSE)\n})\nwrap_plots(ps, ncol = 2) +\n    plot_annotation(tag_levels = 'A')\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.6: A lowess illustration, adapted from Berk (2016).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe function ggplot2::geom_smooth() has the default setting se = TRUE that produces a confidence interval around the smooth. In time series applications, autocorrelated residuals may lead to underestimated standard errors and incorrect (typically, too narrow) confidence intervals. Hence, we set se = FALSE.

    "text": "3.4 Exponential smoothing\nExponential smoothing (ES) is a successful forecasting technique. It turns out that ES can be modified to be used effectively for time series with\n\nslowly drifting trend (double exponential smoothing);\ntrends (Holt’s method);\nseasonal patterns;\ncombination of trend and seasonality (Holt–Winters method).\n\nES is easy to adjust for past errors and easy to prepare follow-on forecasts. ES is ideal for situations where many forecasts must be prepared. Several different functional forms of ES are used depending on presence of trend or cyclical variations.\nIn short, an ES is an averaging technique that uses unequal weights while the weights applied to past observations decline in an exponential manner.\nSingle exponential smoothing calculates the smoothed series as a damping coefficient \\(\\alpha\\) (\\(\\alpha \\in [0, 1]\\)) times the actual series plus \\(1 - \\alpha\\) times the lagged value of the smoothed series. For the model \\[\nY_{t} = M_t + \\epsilon_{t},\n\\]\nthe updating equation is \\[\n\\begin{split}\n\\hat{M}_1 &= Y_1\\\\\n\\hat{M}_t &= \\alpha Y_t + (1 - \\alpha) \\hat{M}_{t - 1}\n\\end{split}\n\\]\nand forecast is \\[\n\\hat{Y}_{t+1} = \\hat{M}_t.\n\\]\nAn exponential smoothing over an already smoothed time series is called double exponential smoothing. In some cases, it might be necessary to extend it even to a triple exponential smoothing.\nHolt’s linear exponential smoothing Suppose that the series \\(Y_t\\) is non-seasonal but displays a trend. Now we need to estimate both the current mean (or level in some professional jargon) and the current trend.\nThe updating equations express ideas similar to those for exponential smoothing. However, now we have two smoothing parameters, \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) (\\(\\alpha \\in [0, 1]\\); \\(\\beta \\in [0, 1]\\)).\nThe updating equations are \\[\na_{t} = \\alpha Y_{t} + \\left( 1- \\alpha \\right) \\left( a_{t - 1} + b_{t - 1} \\right)\n\\] for the mean and \\[\nb_{t} = \\beta \\left( a_{t} - a_{t-1} \\right) + \\left( 1 - \\beta \\right) b_{t-1}\n\\] for the trend.\nThen the forecasting for \\(k\\) steps into the future is \\[\n\\hat{Y}_{t+k} = a_{t} + kb_{t}.\n\\]\nUsually, the initial (starting) values are \\[\n\\begin{split}\na_{1} & = Y_{2}, \\\\\nb_{1} & = Y_{2} - Y_{1}.\n\\end{split}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Shampoo exponential smoothing\n\n\n\nSee an example in Figure 3.10.\n\n\nCode\nclrs <- c(\"0.3\" = 4, \"0.7\" = 2)\nm1 <- HoltWinters(shampoo, alpha = 0.3, beta = FALSE, gamma = FALSE)\nm2 <- HoltWinters(shampoo, alpha = 0.7, beta = FALSE, gamma = FALSE)\np1 <- pshampoo + \n    geom_line(data = fitted(m1)[,1], aes(col = \"0.3\"), lwd = 1.5) + \n    geom_line(data = fitted(m2)[,1], aes(col = \"0.7\"), lwd = 1.5) +\n    ggtitle(\"Simple exponential smoothing\") +\n    labs(color = \"\\u03b1\") +\n    scale_color_manual(values = clrs)\nclrs <- c(\"(0.3, 0.3)\" = 4, \"(0.7, 0.7)\" = 2)\nm1 <- HoltWinters(shampoo, alpha = 0.3, beta = 0.3, gamma = FALSE)\nm2 <- HoltWinters(shampoo, alpha = 0.7, beta = 0.7, gamma = FALSE)\np2 <- pshampoo + \n    geom_line(data = fitted(m1)[,1], aes(col = \"(0.3, 0.3)\"), lwd = 1.5) + \n    geom_line(data = fitted(m2)[,1], aes(col = \"(0.7, 0.7)\"), lwd = 1.5) +\n    ggtitle(\"Holt's method\") +\n    labs(color = \"(\\u03b1, \\u03b2)\") +\n    scale_color_manual(values = clrs)\np1 + p2 +\n    plot_annotation(tag_levels = 'A')\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.10: Shampoo sales over three years smoothed with different exponential smoothing filters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.4.1 Exponential smoothing for seasonal data\nMultiplicative Holt–Winters procedure\nNow in addition to the Holt parameters, suppose that the series exhibits multiplicative seasonality and let \\(S_{t}\\) be the multiplicative seasonal factor at time \\(t\\).\nSuppose also that there are \\(m\\) observations in one period (in a year). For example, \\(m = 4\\) for quarterly data and \\(m = 12\\) for monthly data.\nIn some time series, seasonal variation is so strong it obscures any trends or other cycles, which are important for understanding of the observed process. Holt–Winters smoothing method can remove seasonality and makes long-term fluctuations in the series stand out more clearly.\nA simple way of detecting trend in seasonal data is to take averages over a certain period. If these averages change with time we can say that there is evidence of a trend in the series.\nWe now use three smoothing parameters: \\(\\alpha\\), \\(\\beta\\), and \\(\\gamma\\) (\\(\\alpha \\in [0, 1]\\); \\(\\beta \\in [0, 1]\\); \\(\\gamma \\in [0, 1]\\)).\nThe updating equations for the level (\\(a_t\\)), local trend (\\(b_t\\)), and seasonal factor (\\(S_t\\)) are: \\[\n\\begin{split}\na_{t} & = \\alpha Y_{t} / S_{t - m} + (1 - \\alpha) ( a_{t - 1} + b_{t - 1}), \\\\\nb_{t} & = \\beta (a_{t} - a_{t - 1}) + (1 - \\beta) b_{t - 1}, \\\\\nS_{t} & = \\gamma Y_{t} / a_{t} + (1 - \\gamma) S_{t - m}.\n\\end{split}\n\\]\nThen the forecasting for \\(k\\) steps into the future is \\[\n\\hat{Y}_{t+k} = (a_{t} + kb_{t}) S_{t+k-m},\n\\] where \\(k = 1, 2, \\ldots, m\\).\nTo obtain starting values, one may use an average over the first few periods (years) of the data.\nThe smoothing parameters \\(\\alpha\\), \\(\\beta\\) and \\(\\gamma\\) are estimated by minimizing the sum of the squared one-step prediction errors.\nAdditive Holt–Winters procedure\nThe updating equations are \\[\n\\begin{split}\na_{t} & = \\alpha (Y_{t} - S_{t - m}) + (1 - \\alpha) (a_{t - 1} + b_{t - 1}), \\\\\nb_{t} & = \\beta (a_{t} - a_{t - 1}) + (1 - \\beta) b_{t - 1} \\\\\nS_{t} & = \\gamma (Y_{t} - a_{t}) + (1 - \\gamma) S_{t - m}.\n\\end{split}\n\\]\nThen the forecasting for \\(k\\) steps into the future is \\[\n\\hat{Y}_{t+k} = a_{t} + kb_{t} + S_{t + k - m},\n\\] where \\(k = 1, 2, \\ldots, m\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Airline passengers non-seasonal and seasonal exponential smoothing\n\n\n\nMonthly totals of international airline passengers, 1949–1960 (see Figure 3.11).

    "text": "3.5 Polynomial regression on time\nThis is a very intuitive procedure for fitting parametric trend functions to time series:\n\nMake a parametric model assumption about \\(M_t\\) as a function of time \\(t\\), for example, quadratic trend: \\[\nM_t = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 t + \\beta_2 t^2\n\\]\nFit the model using the usual regression estimators (least squares or maximum likelihood)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nA nonstationary time series with a trend represented by a parametric function is a typical example of a trend-stationary time series or a time series with a deterministic trend. It is easy to make such a time series stationary by modeling and extracting the trend.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Airline passengers non-seasonal polynomial smoothing\n\n\n\nContinue using the AirPassengers data and fit linear and quadratic trends.\n\n\nCode\nt <- as.vector(time(AirPassengers))\nt2 <- t^2\ntm1 <- lm(AirPassengers ~ t)\ntm2.1 <- lm(AirPassengers ~ t + t2)\ntm2.2 <- lm(AirPassengers ~ t + I(t^2))\ntm2.3 <- lm(AirPassengers ~ poly(t, degree = 2))\n\n\nAfter estimating the trend coefficients with OLS, visualize the results (Figure 3.13).\n\n\nCode\np1 <- pAirPassengers + \n    geom_line(aes(y = tm1$fitted.values), col = 4, lwd = 1.5) + \n    ggtitle(\"Linear trend\")\np2 <- pAirPassengers + \n    geom_line(aes(y = tm2.3$fitted.values), col = 4, lwd = 1.5) + \n    ggtitle(\"Quadratic trend\")\np1 + p2 +\n    plot_annotation(tag_levels = 'A')\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.13: The plots of the AirPassengers data with estimated parametric linear and quadratic trends.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe models tm2.1 and tm2.2 are equivalent. Model tm2.1 uses a pre-calculated quadratic transformation, while model tm2.2 applies the transformation on-the-fly within the R formula call, using the I() syntax (without the I() wrapper, the output of tm2.2 would be the same as of tm1, not tm2.1). However, both models tm2.1 and tm2.2 can easily violate the assumption of independence of predictors in linear regression, especially when values of the time index \\(t\\) are large. That is the case for us, because \\(t\\) represents decimal years, from 1949 to 1960.917, and \\(\\widehat{\\mathrm{cor}}(t, t^2) =\\) 1. Therefore, model tm2.3 is preferred, because it is evaluated on orthogonal polynomials (basically, centering and normalization is applied to \\(t\\) and \\(t^2\\)).\n\n\n\n3.5.1 Seasonal regression with dummy variables\nTo each time \\(t\\) and each season \\(k\\) we will assign an indicator which ‘turns on’ if and only if \\(t\\) falls into that season. In principle, a seasonal period of any positive integer length \\(m \\geqslant 2\\) is possible, however, in most cases, the length of the seasonal cycle is one year and so the seasonal period of the time series depends on the number of observations per year. The most common periods are \\(m = 12\\) (monthly data) and \\(m = 4\\) (quarterly data). For each \\(k = 1, \\ldots, m\\), we define the indicator \\[\nX_{k,t} = \\left\\{\n\\begin{array}{cl}\n1, & \\mbox{if} ~ t ~ \\text{corresponds to season} ~ k, \\\\\n0, & \\mbox{if} ~ t ~ \\text{does not correspond to season} ~ k. \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\right.\n\\]\nNote that for each \\(t\\) we have \\(X_{1,t} + X_{2,t} + \\ldots + X_{m,t} = 1\\) since each \\(t\\) corresponds to exactly one season. Thus, given any \\(m - 1\\) of the variables, the remaining variable is known and thus redundant. Because of this linear dependence, we must drop one of the indicator variables (seasons) from the model. It does not matter which season is dropped although sometimes there are choices which are simpler from the point of view of constructing or labeling the design matrix. Thus the general form of a seasonal model looks like \\[\n\\begin{split}\nf (Y_{t}) &= M_{t} + \\beta_{2} X_{2,t} + \\beta_{3} X_{3,t} + \\ldots + \\beta_{m} X_{m,t} + \\epsilon_{t} \\\\\n&= M_{t} + \\sum_{i=2}^{m}\\beta_{i} X_{i,t} + \\epsilon_{t},\n\\end{split}\n\\] where \\(M_{t}\\) is a trend term which may also include some \\(\\beta\\) parameters and explanatory variables. The function \\(f\\) represents the appropriate variance-stabilizing transformations as needed. (Here the 1st season has been dropped from the model.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Airline passengers polynomial smoothing with dummy variables for the seasons\n\n\n\nConsider adding the dummy variables to model seasonality additionally to the quadratic trend in the AirPassengers time series. We noticed multiplicative seasonality in this time series before, therefore we apply logarithmic transformation to the original data to transform the multiplicative seasonality into additive. That is, we need to estimate the model \\[\n\\ln(Y_{t}) = \\alpha_0 + \\alpha_1 t + \\alpha_2 t^2 + \\sum_{i=2}^{12}\\beta_{i} X_{i,t} + \\epsilon_{t},\n\\] where \\(X_{i,t}\\) are the dummy variables for the months. (Here the first month has been dropped from the model, the same as in R the first factor level is dropped.)\nIf we were doing the regression analysis by hand, we would create a design matrix with few top rows looking like this:\n\n\n#>          t      t2 X2 X3 X4 X5 X6 X7 X8 X9 X10 X11 X12\n#>  [1,] 1949 3798601  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0   0   0   0\n#>  [2,] 1949 3798926  1  0  0  0  0  0  0  0   0   0   0\n#>  [3,] 1949 3799251  0  1  0  0  0  0  0  0   0   0   0\n#>  [4,] 1949 3799576  0  0  1  0  0  0  0  0   0   0   0\n#>  [5,] 1949 3799900  0  0  0  1  0  0  0  0   0   0   0\n#>  [6,] 1949 3800225  0  0  0  0  1  0  0  0   0   0   0\n#>  [7,] 1950 3800550  0  0  0  0  0  1  0  0   0   0   0\n#>  [8,] 1950 3800875  0  0  0  0  0  0  1  0   0   0   0\n#>  [9,] 1950 3801200  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  1   0   0   0\n#> [10,] 1950 3801525  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0   1   0   0\n#> [11,] 1950 3801850  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0   0   1   0\n#> [12,] 1950 3802175  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0   0   0   1\n#> [13,] 1950 3802500  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0   0   0   0\n\n\nIn R, it is enough to have one variable representing the seasons.

For example, for monthly observations \\[\n\\begin{split}\ncos_{k} (i) &= \\cos (2 \\pi ki / 12), \\\\\nsin_{k} (i) &= \\sin (2 \\pi ki / 12),\n\\end{split}\n\\] where \\(i\\) is the month within the year, and the trigonometric function has \\(k\\) cycles per year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Airline passengers polynomial smoothing with Fourier series for the seasons\n\n\n\nNow let us apply the method of sinusoids to the AirPassengers time series. We have one prominent and, possibly, one less prominent peak per year. Hence, we can test the model with \\(k = 1\\) and \\(k = 2\\). We will construct the following trigonometric predictors: \\[\n\\begin{split}\ncos_{1,t} &= \\cos(2 \\pi \\text{month}_t/12),\\\\\nsin_{1,t} &= \\sin(2 \\pi \\text{month}_t/12),\\\\\ncos_{2,t} &= \\cos(4 \\pi \\text{month}_t/12),\\\\\nsin_{2,t} &= \\sin(4 \\pi \\text{month}_t/12)\n\\end{split}\n\\] to use in the model \\[\n\\ln(Y_{t}) = \\alpha_0 + \\alpha_1 t + \\alpha_2 t^2 + \\beta_{1}cos_{1,t} + \\beta_{2}sin_{1,t} + \\beta_{3}cos_{2,t} + \\beta_{4}sin_{2,t} + \\epsilon_{t}.\n\\]\nCalculate the predictors and estimate the model in R (see results in Figure 3.15):\n\n\nCode\nmonth <- as.numeric(cycle(AirPassengers))\ncos1 <- cos(2 * pi * month / 12)\nsin1 <- sin(2 * pi * month / 12)\ncos2 <- cos(4 * pi * month / 12)\nsin2 <- sin(4 * pi * month / 12)\nm <- lm(log(AirPassengers) ~ poly(t, degree = 2) + cos1 + sin1 + cos2 + sin2)\nsummary(m)\n\n\n#> \n#> Call:\n#> lm(formula = log(AirPassengers) ~ poly(t, degree = 2) + cos1 + \n#>     sin1 + cos2 + sin2)\n#> \n#> Residuals:\n#>      Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n#> -0.20078 -0.03539 -0.00056  0.04065  0.13771 \n#> \n#> Coefficients:\n#>                      Estimate Std.

    "text": "3.6 Differencing\nA big subset of time series models (particularly, models dealing with random walk series) applies differencing to eliminate trends.\nLet \\(\\Delta\\) be the difference operator (\\(\\nabla\\) notation is also used sometimes), then the simple first-order differences are: \\[\n\\begin{split}\n\\Delta Y_t &= Y_t - Y_{t-1} \\\\\n&=(1-B)Y_t,\n\\end{split}\n\\] where \\(B\\) is a backshift operator.\nBackshift operator and difference operator are useful for convenient representation of higher-order differences. We will often use backshift operators in future lectures: \\[\n\\begin{split}\nB^0Y_{t} &= Y_{t} \\\\\nBY_{t} &= Y_{t-1} \\\\\nB^{2}Y_{t} &= Y_{t-2} \\\\\n& \\vdots \\\\\nB^{k}Y_{t} &= Y_{t-k}.\n\\end{split}\n\\] The convenience is due to the fact that the powers of the operators can be treated as powers of elements of usual polynomials, so we can make different operations for more complex cases.\nFor example, if we took second-order differences, \\(\\Delta^2Y_t = (1-B)^2Y_t\\), to remove a trend and then used differences with the seasonal lag of 12 months to remove strong seasonal component, what would be the final form of transformed series? The transformed series, \\(Y^*_t\\), will be: \\[\n\\begin{split}\nY^*_t & = (1-B)^2 (1 - B^{12})Y_t \\\\\n& = (1 - 2B + B^2) (1 - B^{12})Y_t \\\\\n& = (1 - 2B + B^2 - B^{12} + 2B^{13} - B^{14})Y_t \\\\\n& = Y_t - 2Y_{t-1} + Y_{t-2} - Y_{t-12} + 2Y_{t-13}-Y_{t-14},\n\\end{split}\n\\] but we will often use just the top-row notations.\nWe will discuss formal tests to identify an appropriate order of differences in future lectures (unit-root tests), but for now use the rule of thumb: for time trends looking linear use 1st order differences (\\(\\Delta Y_t = Y_t - Y_{t-1}\\)), for parabolic shapes use differences of the 2nd order, etc. Apply differencing of higher orders until the time series looks stationary (plot the transformed series and its ACF at each step).

To quantify the uncertainty, we provide prediction intervals that are based on the past behavior of residuals and careful residual diagnostics (such as described in the previous lectures).\nThe evaluation of the methods may involve splitting the time series into training and testing periods. Overall, this lecture focused on presenting the methods themselves, while residual diagnostics and evaluation on a testing set were omitted due to time constraints.\nWhile the considered methods are among the most common, there are many more smoothing methods that can be applied to time series: splines (such as used in generalized additive models, GAMs), kernels, machine learning techniques, etc."

    "text": "4.1 Introduction\nAfter removing or modeling trend and strong seasonality in a time series, we need to take care of the stationary remainder, which may be autocorrelated or conditionally heteroskedastic. Here we introduce a broad class of ARMA models that deal with autocorrelation in time series.\nRecall that a time series is (weakly) stationary if its mean and autocovariance do not depend on time, \\(t\\); autocovariance depends only on the lag \\(h\\). We will use these two conditions to show that the time series processes that we will model as AR, MA, or ARMA are stationary. Remember that presence of autocorrelation does not mean that there is a trend.\nWe start by checking the two conditions for other typical univariate processes, white noise and random walk.\n\n\nCode\n# Set seed for reproducible random number generation\nset.seed(123) \nT <- 300L\nLag <- 0:15\n\n\nMost of the examples in this lecture are simulated to show how sample autocorrelations may differ from theoretical ones, even if the simulated time series are sampled from a process of a certain type. All simulated series are of length 300.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Check stationarity of white noise\n\n\n\nLet \\(X_t\\) be a white noise series, \\(X_t \\sim \\mathrm{WN}(0, \\sigma^2)\\). Show that \\(X_t\\) is weakly stationary.\n\\(\\mathrm{E}(X_t) = 0\\) for all \\(t\\) \\(\\Rightarrow\\) \\(\\mathrm{E}(X_t)\\) is independent of \\(t\\).\nNow check the autocovariance \\[\n\\mathrm{cov}(X_t, X_{t+h}) =\n\\begin{cases}\n\\mathrm{cov}(X_t, X_t) & \\text{if } h = 0\\\\\n0                      & \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases} =\n\\begin{cases}\n\\mathrm{var}(X_t) & \\text{if } h = 0\\\\\n0                 & \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases} =\n\\begin{cases}\n\\sigma^2 & \\text{if } h = 0\\\\\n0        & \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\\(\\Rightarrow\\) \\(\\mathrm{cov}(X_t, X_{t+h})\\) does not depend on \\(t\\), depends only on \\(h\\).\nBoth conditions of weak stationarity are satisfied, \\(X_t\\) is weakly stationary.\n\n\nSee Figure 4.1 with plots for \\(X_t \\sim \\mathrm{WN}(0, \\sigma^2)\\), where \\(\\sigma = 2\\).

This is the condition under which AR(1) process is (weakly) stationary. E.g., if \\(\\phi_{1} = \\pm 1\\) then the process is a random walk and is also not stationary. We shall see later that all AR processes require some condition of this nature.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Check stationarity of AR(1)\n\n\n\nShow that AR(1) process \\(Y_t\\) is stationary, \\(Y_t = \\phi Y_{t-1} + Z_t\\), \\(|\\phi| < 1\\), \\(Z_t \\sim \\mathrm{WN}(0, \\sigma^2)\\).\n\\[\n\\begin{split}\n\\mathrm{E}(Y_t) &= \\mathrm{E}(\\phi Y_{t-1} + Z_t)\\\\\n& = \\phi \\mathrm{E}(Y_{t-1}) + \\mathrm{E}(Z_t)\\\\\n& = \\phi^2 \\mathrm{E}(Y_{t-2}) + 0\\\\\n& = \\phi^3 \\mathrm{E}(Y_{t-3})\\\\\n& = \\ldots\\\\\n& = \\phi^N \\mathrm{E}(Y_{t-N})\\\\\n\\lim_{N \\rightarrow \\infty} \\mathrm{E}(Y_t) &= \\lim_{N \\rightarrow \\infty} \\phi^N \\mathrm{E}(Y_{t-N}) = 0\n\\end{split}\n\\] Therefore, mean of \\(Y_t\\) does not depend on time.\nNow check autocovariance. For \\(h=0\\), \\(\\mathrm{cov}(Y_t, Y_{t}) = \\mathrm{var}(Y_t) = \\sigma^2_Y\\), which is derived in Equation 4.4 and does not depend on time.\nFor \\(h \\neq 0\\), \\[\n\\begin{split}\n\\mathrm{cov}(Y_t, Y_{t-h}) &= \\mathrm{cov}(\\phi Y_{t-1} + Z_t, Y_{t-h})\\\\\n& = \\mathrm{cov}(\\phi Y_{t-1}, Y_{t-h}) + \\mathrm{cov}(Z_t, Y_{t-h})\\\\\n& = \\phi \\mathrm{cov}(Y_{t-1}, Y_{t-h}) + 0\\\\\n& = \\phi \\mathrm{cov}(\\phi Y_{t-2} + Z_{t-1}, Y_{t-h})\\\\\n& = \\phi^2 \\gamma_Y(h-2)\\\\\n& = \\ldots\\\\\n& = \\phi^h \\gamma_Y(0) = \\phi^h \\sigma_Y^2,\n\\end{split}\n\\] thus autocovariance does not depend on time, depends on lag \\(h\\).\nBoth conditions for weak stationarity are satisfied, \\(Y_t\\) specified above is weakly stationary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAdditionally, see that ACF of this process \\[\n\\rho_Y(h) = \\frac{\\gamma_Y(h)}{\\gamma_Y(0)} = \\frac{\\phi^h \\gamma_Y(0)}{\\gamma_Y(0)} = \\phi^h\n\\] shows exponential decay. Remember this about AR processes.\n\n\nAR(\\(p\\)) model\nNow we can extend our AR(1) model to \\[\n\\begin{split}\nY_{t} &= \\phi_{1} Y_{t  - 1} + \\phi_{2} Y_{t - 2} + \\ldots + \\phi_{p} Y_{t - p} + \\epsilon_{t} \\\\\n&=\\sum_{i=1}^p\\phi_iY_{t-i} + \\epsilon_t\n\\end{split}\n\\tag{4.5}\\] with \\(\\epsilon_{t}\\) independent of \\(Y_{t - k}, \\ldots , Y_{t - 1}\\); \\(p \\in \\mathbb{N}^{+}\\). This model is called an autoregressive model of order \\(p\\), or simply an AR(\\(p\\)) model.\nSimilarly to AR(1), every AR(\\(p\\)) model may be rewritten as \\[\n\\left(1 -  \\sum^{p}_{i = 1} \\phi_{i} B^{i} \\right) Y_{t} = \\epsilon_{t},\n\\] or in more compact notation as \\[\n\\phi (B) Y_t = \\epsilon_t,\n\\] where \\(\\phi(\\lambda)\\) is the polynomial \\(\\phi(\\lambda) = 1 - \\phi_{1} \\lambda - \\phi_{2} \\lambda^{2} - \\ldots - \\phi_{p} \\lambda^{p}\\).\nThe stationarity condition for AR(\\(p\\)) model is defined through the polynomial \\(\\phi(\\lambda)\\). Specifically, all the roots of the function \\(\\phi(\\lambda)\\) lie outside the unit circle in the complex plane.\nTo compute ACVF and ACF for the AR(\\(p\\)) model, multiplying both sides of Equation 4.5 by \\(Y_{t - k}\\) for \\(k \\geqslant p\\) and taking expectations yields \\[\n\\begin{split}\n\\mathrm{E} \\left( Y_{t} Y_{t - k} \\right) & =  \\mathrm{E} \\left( \\phi_{1} Y_{t-1} Y_{t-k} + \\phi_{2} Y_{t-2} Y_{t-k} + \\ldots + \\phi_{p} Y_{t -p} Y_{t - k} + \\epsilon_{t} Y_{t -k} \\right) \\\\\n& =  \\phi_{1}  \\mathrm{E} \\left( Y_{t  - 1} Y_{t - k} \\right) + \\phi_{2} \\mathrm{E} \\left( Y_{t - 2} Y_{t - k} \\right) + \\ldots+ \\phi_{p} \\mathrm{E} \\left(Y_{t - p} Y_{t - k} \\right) + \\mathrm{E} \\left( \\epsilon_{t} Y_{t  - k} \\right).\n\\end{split}\n\\]\nThus, we get autocovariances \\[\n\\gamma(k) = \\phi_{1}\\gamma(k -1) + \\phi_{2}\\gamma(k - 2) + \\ldots + \\phi_{p} \\gamma(k  - p),\n\\] which turns into a mixed exponential decay of order \\(p\\) for the ACF \\[\n\\rho(k) = \\phi_{1} \\rho(k - 1) + \\phi_{2} \\rho(k - 2) + \\ldots + \\phi_{p} \\rho(k - p).\n\\]\nTo start off the decay we need the \\(p\\) starting correlations \\(\\rho(1), \\rho(2), \\ldots , \\rho(p)\\), which we can solve for from the parameters \\(\\phi_{1} ,\\phi_{2} , \\ldots , \\phi_{p}\\).\nPACF of AR processes\nAn AR(\\(p\\)) model implies \\(Y_{t+h} = \\sum_{i=1}^p\\phi_{i} Y_{t + h - i} + \\epsilon_{t+h}\\), where the roots of \\(\\phi(\\lambda)\\) are outside the unit circle. When \\(h > p\\), the regression of \\(Y_{t+h}\\) on \\(\\{ Y_{t+1},\\ldots, Y_{t+h-1}\\}\\), is \\[\n\\hat{Y}_{t+h} = \\sum^p_{i=1} \\phi_i Y_{t+h-i}.\n\\] Thus, when \\(h > p\\), \\[\n\\rho_{hh} = \\mathrm{cor}(Y_{t+h}-\\hat{Y}_{t+h}, Y_t - \\hat{Y}_t) = \\mathrm{cor}(\\epsilon_{t+h}, Y_t - \\hat{Y}_t) = 0,\n\\] because, by causality of the process, \\(Y_t - \\hat{Y}_t\\), depends only on \\(\\{ \\epsilon_{t+h-1}, \\epsilon_{t+h-2},\\ldots \\}\\).\nWhen \\(h\\leqslant p\\), \\(\\rho_{hh}\\) is not zero, and \\(\\rho_{11}, \\ldots, \\rho_{p-1,p-1}\\) are not necessarily zero.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe important conclusion is that PACF of an AR(\\(p\\)) process necessarily cuts off (PACF = 0) after lag \\(p\\).\n\n\nSee the plots for the following AR(1) process in Figure 4.4: \\[\nX_t = \\phi_1 X_{t-1} + \\epsilon_t;\\; \\epsilon_t \\sim N(0,\\sigma^2);\\; \\phi_1=0.6,\\; \\sigma = 1.\n\\tag{4.6}\\]\n\n\nCode\n# Theoretical ACF, PACF\nphi <- 0.6\nRHO <- phi^Lag\nALPHA <- c(1, phi, rep(0, max(Lag) - 1))\n# Sample data\nX <- arima.sim(list(order = c(1, 0, 0), ar = phi), n = T)\n# Plots\np1 <- ggplot(data.frame(Lag, ACF = RHO), aes(x = Lag, y = ACF)) +\n    geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +\n    ggtitle(\"Theoretical ACF\") +\n    theme_light()\np2 <- ggplot(data.frame(Lag, PACF = ALPHA), aes(x = Lag, y = PACF)) +\n    geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +\n    ggtitle(\"Theoretical PACF\") +\n    theme_light()\np3 <- forecast::autoplot(X) + \n    ggtitle(\"Sample time series\") +\n    theme_light()\np4 <- forecast::ggAcf(X) + \n    ggtitle(\"Sample ACF\") +\n    theme_light()\np5 <- forecast::ggAcf(X, type = \"partial\") + \n    ggtitle(\"Sample PACF\") +\n    theme_light()\n(plot_spacer() + p1 + p2) / (p3 + p4 + p5) +\n    plot_annotation(tag_levels = 'A')\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.4: AR(1) process as specified in Equation 4.6.\n\n\n\n\nSee the plots for the following AR(1) process in Figure 4.5 (only the coefficient \\(\\phi_1\\) changed from the previous specification): \\[\nX_t = \\phi_1 X_{t-1} + \\epsilon_t;\\; \\epsilon_t \\sim N(0,\\sigma^2);\\; \\phi_1=-0.6,\\; \\sigma = 1.\n\\tag{4.7}\\]\n\n\nCode\n# Theoretical ACF, PACF\nphi <- -0.6\nRHO <- phi^Lag\nALPHA <- c(1, phi, rep(0, max(Lag) - 1))\n# Sample data\nX <- arima.sim(list(order = c(1, 0, 0), ar = phi), n = T)\n# Plots\np1 <- ggplot(data.frame(Lag, ACF = RHO), aes(x = Lag, y = ACF)) +\n    geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +\n    ggtitle(\"Theoretical ACF\") +\n    theme_light()\np2 <- ggplot(data.frame(Lag, PACF = ALPHA), aes(x = Lag, y = PACF)) +\n    geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +\n    ggtitle(\"Theoretical PACF\") +\n    theme_light()\np3 <- forecast::autoplot(X) + \n    ggtitle(\"Sample time series\") +\n    theme_light()\np4 <- forecast::ggAcf(X) + \n    ggtitle(\"Sample ACF\") +\n    theme_light()\np5 <- forecast::ggAcf(X, type = \"partial\") + \n    ggtitle(\"Sample PACF\") +\n    theme_light()\n(plot_spacer() + p1 + p2) / (p3 + p4 + p5) +\n    plot_annotation(tag_levels = 'A')\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.5: AR(1) process as specified in Equation 4.7.\n\n\n\n\nACF of AR(1) model takes two graphical forms depending on whether the coefficient \\(\\phi_{1}\\) is positive or negative. In the first case, the decay occurs through the positive axis only (Figure 4.4). In the second case, the decay alternates between the negative and positive axes (Figure 4.5). This is so-called mixed exponential decay. Although both forms are examples of exponential decay, they appear different visually and you must learn to recognize both.\nAs the order \\(p\\) of an AR(\\(p\\)) model increases, the number of different visual presentations of the ACF increases as well. The ACF of an AR(\\(p\\)) model can take \\(2^{p}\\) different graphical forms, depending on the signs (positive or negative) of the parameters \\(\\phi_{1} , \\phi_{2}, \\ldots, \\phi_{p}\\). Thus, the ACF of an AR(2) model can take \\(2^{2} = 4\\) different graphical forms.\n\n\n4.2.2 The Yule–Wold representation and linear processes\nA process \\(X_{t}\\), (\\(t = 0, \\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\ldots\\)) is said to be linear if it has a representation of the form \\[\nX_{t} = \\mu + \\sum^{\\infty}_{r = - \\infty} c_{r} \\epsilon_{t - r},\n\\] where\n\n\\(\\mu\\) is a common mean,\n\\(c_{r}\\) is a sequence of fixed constants,\n\\(\\epsilon_{t}\\) are uncorrelated random variables with mean 0 and common variance.\n\nWe assume \\(\\sum c^{2}_{r} < \\infty\\) to ensure that the variances of individual \\(X_{t}\\) are finite (stationarity and existence condition). Then the process \\(X_{t}\\) is necessarily (weakly) stationary.\nIf in addition we require that \\(\\epsilon_{t}\\) are identically distributed, then \\(X_{t}\\) is strictly stationary. For example, see the case of normally distributed \\(\\epsilon_{t}\\).\nIf \\(c_r = 0\\) for all \\(r < 0\\), \\(X_t\\) is called causal (i.e., the process at time \\(t\\) does not depend on the future, yet unobserved, values of \\(\\epsilon_{t}\\)).\nThe representation of a causal stationary process \\(X_{t}\\) with 0 mean in the form \\[\nX_{t} = \\sum^{\\infty}_{r = 0}  c_{r} \\epsilon_{t - r},\n\\tag{4.8}\\] where \\(\\epsilon_{t} \\sim \\mathrm{WN}(0, \\sigma^{2}\\)) and \\(\\sum c^{2}_{r} < \\infty\\), is sometimes called the Yule–Wald representation.\n\n\n4.2.3 Moving average (MA) models\nMA(1) model\nA zero mean stationary process \\(Y_{t}\\) is called a moving average process of order 1, or an MA(1) model, if \\(Y_{t}\\) satisfies \\[\nY_{t} = \\epsilon_{t} + \\theta_{1}  \\epsilon_{t - 1},\n\\] where \\(\\epsilon_{t}\\) is white noise.\nIn other words, an MA(1) process has \\(c_{r} = 0\\) for every \\(r > 1\\) in its Yule–Wold representation Equation 4.8.\nThe MA(1) model may be rewritten as \\[\nY_{t} = (1 + \\theta_{1} B) \\epsilon_{t},\n\\] or in the compact form as \\[\nY_t = \\theta (B) \\epsilon_t,\n\\] where \\(\\theta (\\lambda)\\) is the polynomial \\(\\theta(\\lambda) = 1 + \\theta_{1} \\lambda\\).\nMA(q) model\nWe can extend MA(1) model further and consider \\[\n\\begin{split}\nY_{t} &= \\epsilon_{t} + \\theta_{1} \\epsilon_{t -1} + \\theta_{2} \\epsilon_{t - 2} + \\ldots + \\theta_{q} \\epsilon_{t - q} \\\\\n&= \\epsilon_{t} + \\sum_{i=1}^q \\theta_i \\epsilon_{t-i}.\n\\end{split}\n\\] This model is called a moving average model of order \\(q\\), or a MA(\\(q\\)).\nWe can write down MA(\\(q\\)) as \\[\nY_{t} = \\left(1 + \\theta_{1} B + \\theta_{2} B^{2} + \\ldots + \\theta_{q} B^{q} \\right) \\epsilon_{t} ,\n\\] or in the compact form as \\[\nY_t = \\theta (B) \\epsilon_t,\n\\] where \\(\\theta(\\lambda)\\) is the polynomial \\(\\theta(\\lambda) = 1 + \\theta_{1} \\lambda + \\theta_{2} \\lambda^{2} + \\ldots + \\theta_{q} \\lambda^{q}\\).\nNow compute ACVF and ACF of the MA(\\(q\\)) process \\(Y_{t}\\). Using the Yule–Wald representation of \\(Y_{t}\\), \\[\nY_{t} = \\sum^{q}_{r = 0} \\theta_{r} \\epsilon_{t - r},\n\\] the autocovariance \\[\n\\begin{split}\n\\gamma_Y(h) & = \\mathrm{cov}(Y_{t}, Y_{t+h}) = \\mathrm{cov} \\left( \\sum^{q}_{r = 0} \\theta_{r }\\epsilon_{t - r}, \\sum^{q}_{\\ell = 0} \\theta_{\\ell} \\epsilon_{t + h - \\ell} \\right) \\\\\n\\\\\n& =  \\sum^{q}_{r = 0} \\sum^{q}_{\\ell = 0} \\mathrm{cov} \\left( \\theta_{r } \\epsilon_{t - r},  \\theta_{\\ell} \\epsilon_{t + h - \\ell} \\right) \\\\\n\\\\\n& =   \\sum^{q}_{r = 0}   \\sum^{q}_{\\ell = 0} \\theta_{r } \\theta_{\\ell} \\mathrm{cov}  \\left( \\epsilon_{t - r}, \\epsilon_{t - r}  \\right) ~~ \\text{since cov} \\left( \\epsilon_{u}, \\epsilon_{v}  \\right) = 0 ~ \\text{unless} ~ u = v \\\\\n\\\\\n& =  \\sigma_{\\epsilon}^{2} \\sum^{q}_{r = 0} \\theta_{r} \\theta_{r+h}.\n\\end{split}\n\\] Note that the case of no time shift between the noise series, i.e., when \\(t-r = t+h-l\\), leads to \\(l=r+h\\), which is used in the last row.\nHence, \\[\n\\gamma_Y(h) = \\left\\{\n\\begin{array}{lcl}\n\\sigma_{\\epsilon}^{2} \\sum^{q  - h}_{r = 0} \\theta_{r} \\theta_{r+h} & \\text{for} &  h \\leqslant q;\\\\\n0 & \\text{for} & h > q.\n\\end{array}\n\\right.\n\\tag{4.9}\\]\nThis leads us to the most important result about the correlation structure for MA(\\(q\\)) processes. For an MA(\\(q\\)) process, \\(\\gamma(h) = 0\\) for all \\(h > q\\). Equivalently, the ACF has \\(q\\) ‘starting’ correlations or spikes, \\(\\rho(1), \\rho(2), \\ldots, \\rho(q)\\), and then \\(\\rho(h) = 0\\) for \\(h > q\\). We say that the ACF ‘cuts off’ after lag \\(q\\).\nNow compute the actual values of the starting correlations \\(\\rho(1), \\ldots, \\rho(q)\\) in terms of the parameters \\(\\theta_{0} = 1, \\theta_{1}, \\theta_{2}, \\ldots, \\theta_{q}\\). Using Equation 4.9, we get\n\nFor the MA(1) model \\(q = 1\\). Hence \\[\n\\begin{split}\nh  =  0 &\\rightarrow \\gamma(0) = \\sigma^{2} \\sum^{1}_{ r=0}  \\theta^{2}_{r} = \\sigma^{2} \\left( \\theta^{2}_{0} + \\theta^{2}_{1} \\right) = \\sigma^{2} \\left(1 + \\theta^{2}_{1}\\right). \\\\\n\\\\\nh  =  1 &\\rightarrow \\gamma(1) = \\sigma^{2}  \\sum^{0}_{ r=0}  \\theta_{r} \\theta_{r + 1} = \\sigma^{2} \\theta_{0} \\theta_{1} = \\sigma^{2} \\theta_{1}.\n\\end{split}\n\\]\nTherefore \\(\\rho(1) = \\gamma(1) / \\gamma(0) = \\theta_{1} / (1 + \\theta^{2}_{1})\\).\nFor the MA(2) model \\(q = 2\\). Hence \\[\n\\begin{split}\nh =  0 &\\rightarrow \\gamma(0) = \\sigma^{2} \\sum^{2}_{r=0}  \\theta^{2}_{r} = \\sigma^{2} \\left(1 + \\theta^{2}_{1} + \\theta^{2}_{2}\\right). \\\\\n\\\\\nh  =  1 &\\rightarrow \\gamma(1) = \\sigma^{2} \\sum^{1}_{r=0}  \\theta_{r} \\theta_{r + 1} = \\sigma^{2} \\left(\\theta_{1} + \\theta_{1} \\theta_{2} \\right) = \\sigma^{2} \\theta_{1}  \\left(1 + \\theta_{2}\\right). \\\\\n\\\\\nh  =  2 &\\rightarrow \\gamma(2) = \\sigma^{2} \\sum^{0}_{r=0}  \\theta_{r} \\theta_{r + 2} = \\sigma^{2} \\theta_{2}.\n\\end{split}\n\\] Therefore \\(\\rho(1) = \\frac{\\gamma(1)}{\\gamma(0)} = \\frac{\\theta_{1} \\left(1 + \\theta_{2} \\right)}{1+ \\theta^{2}_{1} + \\theta^{2}_{2}}\\) and \\(\\rho(2) = \\frac{\\gamma(2)}{\\gamma(0)} = \\frac{\\theta_{2}}{1+ \\theta^{2}_{1} + \\theta^{2}_{2}}\\).\nProceed analogously for the MA(\\(q\\)) model.\n\nAnother method of obtaining the correlation coefficients of the MA(\\(q\\)) is to derive the covariance \\(\\gamma(h) = \\mathrm{cov} (Y_{t}, Y_{t - h} )\\) directly by using the bilinear properties of covariance and determining the interaction between the white noise terms. The advantage of this method is that you do not have to memorize anything. Moreover, since white noise has the property that \\(\\mathrm{cov} (\\epsilon_{u}, \\epsilon_{v}) = 0\\) whenever \\(u \\neq v\\), interactions occur only when the time indices match up, i.e., only when \\(u = v\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Calculate ACF of MA(\\(q\\))\n\n\n\nConsider an MA(1) model. Let \\(h \\geqslant 0\\). Applying the covariance properties we obtain the general expression: \\[\n\\begin{split}\n\\gamma(h) & =  \\mathrm{cov}\\left( Y_{t}, Y_{t - h} \\right) =  \\mathrm{cov} \\left( \\epsilon_{t} + \\theta_{1} \\epsilon_{t - 1}, \\epsilon_{t - h} + \\theta_{1} \\epsilon_{t - h - 1}  \\right) \\\\\n& =  \\mathrm{cov} \\left( \\epsilon_{t},  \\epsilon_{t - h} \\right) + \\theta_{1} \\mathrm{cov} \\left(  \\epsilon_{t},  \\epsilon_{t - h - 1}  \\right) + \\theta_{1} \\mathrm{cov} \\left( \\epsilon_{t - 1}, \\epsilon_{t - h} \\right) + \\theta^{2}_{1} \\mathrm{cov} \\left(\\epsilon_{t - 1}, \\epsilon_{t - h - 1} \\right).\n\\end{split}\n\\]\nNote that the covariances in the last line of the above expression will be nonzero if the time indices match up. Plugging different values of \\(h\\) into the above equation we obtain \\[\n\\begin{split}\nh  =  0 &\\rightarrow \\gamma(0) =   \\mathrm{cov} \\left( \\epsilon_{t},   \\epsilon_{t} \\right)  + 0 + 0 + \\theta^{2}_{1}  \\mathrm{cov} \\left( \\epsilon_{t - 1},  \\epsilon_{t - 1}  \\right) = \\sigma^{2} + \\theta^{2}_{1} \\sigma^{2} = \\sigma^{2} \\left( 1 + \\theta^{2}_{1} \\right). \\\\\n\\\\\nh  =  1 &\\rightarrow \\gamma(1) = 0 + 0 + \\theta_{1}  \\mathrm{cov} \\left( \\epsilon_{t - 1},  \\epsilon_{t - 1}  \\right) + 0 = \\sigma^{2} \\theta_{1}.\\\\\n\\\\\nh \\geqslant 2 &\\rightarrow \\gamma(h) = 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 0.\n\\end{split}\n\\]\nThis method generalizes easily to computing covariances for MA(\\(q\\)) models of higher order.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWe have explicitly determined the structure of the ACF of an MA(\\(q\\)) process. Its most important feature is that \\(\\rho(h) = 0\\) for \\(h > q\\). Remember this about MA processes.\n\n\nFiner features, such as expressing the \\(\\rho(h)\\) in terms of the \\(\\theta_{r}\\) coefficients, can be determined as above.\nPACF of MA processes\nFor an MA(\\(q\\)), we can write \\(Y_t = -\\sum_{j=1}^{\\infty} \\pi_j Y_{t-j} + \\epsilon_t\\). Moreover, no finite representation exists. From this result, it should be apparent that the PACF will never cut off, as in the case of an AR(\\(p\\)). For an MA(1), \\(Y_t = \\epsilon_t +\\theta \\epsilon_{t-1}\\), with \\(|\\theta| < 1\\), it can be shown that (Shumway and Stoffer 2014): \\[\n\\rho_{hh} = - \\frac{(-\\theta)^h (1 - \\theta^2)}{1 - \\theta^{2(h+1)}}, \\; h \\geqslant 1.\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nEvery MA(\\(q\\)) process has an infinite autoregressive expansion and its PACF never cuts off. In fact, it can be shown that the PACF of an MA(\\(q\\)) process damps out according to a mixed exponential decay of order \\(q\\).\n\n\nWe do not have to compute the PACF by performing numerous regressions first. The computations are done via a recursive formula.\nSimilar to AR(1) examples above, now consider two sets of plots for MA(1) processes with positive and negative coefficient. For the MA(1) process \\[\nX_t = \\theta_1 \\epsilon_{t-1} + \\epsilon_t;\\; \\epsilon_t \\sim N(0,\\sigma^2);\\; \\theta_1=0.3,\\; \\sigma = 1,\n\\tag{4.10}\\] see plots in Figure 4.6.\n\n\nCode\n# Theoretical ACF, PACF\ntheta <- 0.3\nRHO <- c(1, theta/(1 + theta^2), rep(0, max(Lag) - 1))\nALPHA <- c(1, ARMAacf(ma = theta, lag.max = max(Lag), pacf = TRUE))\n# Sample data\nX <- arima.sim(list(order = c(0, 0, 1), ma = theta), n = T)\n# Plots\np1 <- ggplot(data.frame(Lag, ACF = RHO), aes(x = Lag, y = ACF)) +\n    geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +\n    ggtitle(\"Theoretical ACF\") +\n    theme_light()\np2 <- ggplot(data.frame(Lag, PACF = ALPHA), aes(x = Lag, y = PACF)) +\n    geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +\n    ggtitle(\"Theoretical PACF\") +\n    theme_light()\np3 <- forecast::autoplot(X) + \n    ggtitle(\"Sample time series\") +\n    theme_light()\np4 <- forecast::ggAcf(X) + \n    ggtitle(\"Sample ACF\") +\n    theme_light()\np5 <- forecast::ggAcf(X, type = \"partial\") + \n    ggtitle(\"Sample PACF\") +\n    theme_light()\n(plot_spacer() + p1 + p2) / (p3 + p4 + p5) +\n    plot_annotation(tag_levels = 'A')\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.6: MA(1) as specified in Equation 4.10.\n\n\n\n\nFor the MA(1) process with negative \\(\\theta_1\\), \\[\nX_t = \\theta_1 \\epsilon_{t-1} + \\epsilon_t;\\; \\epsilon_t \\sim N(0,\\sigma^2);\\; \\theta_1=-0.3,\\; \\sigma = 1,\n\\tag{4.11}\\] see plots in Figure 4.7.\n\n\nCode\n# Theoretical ACF, PACF\ntheta <- -0.3\nRHO <- c(1, theta/(1 + theta^2), rep(0, max(Lag) - 1))\nALPHA <- c(1, ARMAacf(ma = theta, lag.max = max(Lag), pacf = TRUE))\n# Sample data\nX <- arima.sim(list(order = c(0, 0, 1), ma = theta), n = T)\n# Plots\np1 <- ggplot(data.frame(Lag, ACF = RHO), aes(x = Lag, y = ACF)) +\n    geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +\n    ggtitle(\"Theoretical ACF\") +\n    theme_light()\np2 <- ggplot(data.frame(Lag, PACF = ALPHA), aes(x = Lag, y = PACF)) +\n    geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +\n    ggtitle(\"Theoretical PACF\") +\n    theme_light()\np3 <- forecast::autoplot(X) + \n    ggtitle(\"Sample time series\") +\n    theme_light()\np4 <- forecast::ggAcf(X) + \n    ggtitle(\"Sample ACF\") +\n    theme_light()\np5 <- forecast::ggAcf(X, type = \"partial\") + \n    ggtitle(\"Sample PACF\") +\n    theme_light()\n(plot_spacer() + p1 + p2) / (p3 + p4 + p5) +\n    plot_annotation(tag_levels = 'A')\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.7: MA(1) as specified in Equation 4.11."

    "text": "4.5 Example analysis\n\n\n\nSuppose you are given a univariate time series \\(Y_t\\).\nFirst, plot the data (Figure 4.8).\n\n\nCode\nggplot2::autoplot(Y) +\n    theme_light()\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.8: Plot of the time series \\(Y_t\\).\n\n\n\n\nIf no obvious trend, plot sample ACF and PACF (Figure 4.9).\n\n\nCode\np1 <- forecast::ggAcf(Y) +\n    ggtitle(\"\") +\n    theme_light()\np2 <- forecast::ggAcf(Y, type = \"partial\") +\n    ggtitle(\"\") +\n    theme_light()\np1 + p2 +\n    plot_annotation(tag_levels = 'A')\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.9: Estimated ACF and PACF of \\(Y_t\\).\n\n\n\n\nBased on the plots (Figure 4.9), ACF decays faster than linearly (some indication of stationarity), PACF is non-zero up to lag 2 (cuts off after lag 2). Knowing the expected behavior of ACF and PACF for ARMA models (see Table 4.1), ARMA(2,0) can be suggested in this case.\nGiven the potential sample variability affecting the estimates of ACF and PACF, there could be other model specifications close to the selected one that may perform similarly or even slightly better when compared to the selected based on the visual analysis. For example, we can check other suitable combinations within the maximal lag of 2 we identified: ARMA(1,0), (2,0), (0,1), (1,1), (2,1), (0,2), (1,2), and ARMA(2,2). With so many choices, we need some quantitative criteria to select the best model.\nThe code below uses a ‘manual’ approach of calculating Akaike and Bayesian information criteria (AIC and BIC) to select the model from the specified set, but see the next section for R functions that do it more automatically.\n\n\nCode\n# Combinations of p and q, without p = q = 0\nresults <- expand.grid(p = c(0, 1, 2), q = c(0, 1, 2))[-1, ] \nfor (i in 1:nrow(results)) {\n    mod <- arima(Y, order = c(results$p[i], 0, results$q[i]))\n    results$aic[i] <- mod$aic\n    results$bic[i] <- BIC(mod)\n}\nresults\n\n\n#>   p q aic bic\n#> 2 1 0 851 862\n#> 3 2 0 838 853\n#> 4 0 1 987 998\n#> 5 1 1 839 854\n#> 6 2 1 840 859\n#> 7 0 2 915 929\n#> 8 1 2 841 859\n#> 9 2 2 842 864\n\n\n\n4.5.1 Automatic model selection\nFor example, the function stats::ar() by default uses the Yule–Walker method to estimate the coefficients and AIC to select the best order for AR(\\(p\\)) model, where the maximum of \\(p\\) can be set by user.\n\n\nCode\nar(Y, order.max = 11)\n\n\n#> \n#> Call:\n#> ar(x = Y, order.max = 11)\n#> \n#> Coefficients:\n#>     1      2  \n#> 0.612  0.220  \n#> \n#> Order selected 2  sigma^2 estimated as  0.939\n\n\nThe function funtimes::ARest() is a wrapper for stats::ar(). It adds a difference-based estimator by Hall and Van Keilegom (2003), which is now used by default, and also switches to BIC as the model selection criterion. The selection is still done only for the order \\(p\\) in AR(\\(p\\)), without considering the possibility of MA terms.\n\n\nCode\n# Order selection with BIC and estimation with HVK\nfuntimes::ARest(Y)\n\n\n#> [1] 0.571 0.176\n\n\nCode\n# To check the correspondence with ar(), change the method and fix the ar.order\n# (turn off automatic selection):\nfuntimes::ARest(Y, ar.method = \"yw\", ar.order = 2, BIC = FALSE)\n\n\n#> [1] 0.612 0.220\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nBIC selects more parsimonious models than AIC does. Such simpler models are usually preferred for forecasting tasks.\n\n\nThe function fable::ARIMA() searches over possible ARMA models within some order constraints (the default maximal orders and search strategy are different from the two functions above – see help files for each function in R). This function is a successor of the function forecast::auto.arima() and is probably the most comprehensive R function for estimating and selecting ARMA models. It allows to fit and select not only ARMA(\\(p,q\\)) models, but also more complex models that will be described later in the course.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(fable)\nm <- as_tsibble(Y) %>% \n    model(ARIMA(Y ~ 1, ic = \"bic\"))\nreport(m)\n\n\n#> Series: Y \n#> Model: ARIMA(2,0,0) w/ mean \n#> \n#> Coefficients:\n#>          ar1     ar2  constant\n#>       0.6100  0.2184    0.0466\n#> s.e.  0.0562  0.0562    0.0545\n#> \n#> sigma^2 estimated as 0.9383:  log likelihood=-415\n#> AIC=838   AICc=838   BIC=853\n\n\nIn all considered cases the model ARMA(2,0), which is equivalent to AR(2), was selected. Our next step is the residual diagnostics – check the residuals for homoscedasticity, uncorrelatedness, and normality (Figure 4.10).\n\n\nCode\nfeasts::gg_tsresiduals(m)\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.10: Residual diagnostics for the ARMA(2,0) model estimated using the package fable.\n\n\n\n\nBased on the plots, the residuals do not violate the assumptions, so proceed with forecasting (Figure 4.11).\n\n\nCode\nm %>%\n    forecast(h = 10) %>%\n    autoplot(Y) + \n    theme_light()\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.11: Predictions 10 steps ahead from the ARMA(2,0) model estimated using the package fable.\n\n\n\n\nHowever, the syntax of the package fable is quite different from its alternatives. See Figure 4.12 with results still plotted using the package ggplot2, but obtained using the base-R functions. Also see the base-R function tsdiag() for residual diagnostics.\n\n\nCode\nm <- arima(Y, order = c(2, 0, 0))\ne <- m$residuals\np1 <- ggplot2::autoplot(e) + \n    ylab(\"Residuals\") +\n    theme_light()\np2 <- forecast::ggAcf(e) +\n    ggtitle(\"\") +\n    theme_light()\np3 <- ggplot(data.frame(e = e), aes(sample = e)) + \n    stat_qq() + \n    stat_qq_line() +\n    xlab(\"Quantiles of N(0,1)\") +\n    ylab(\"Sample quantiles\") +\n    theme_light()\np4 <- ggplot2::autoplot(forecast(m, h = 10)) + \n    theme_light()\np1 / (p2 + p3) / p4 +\n    plot_annotation(tag_levels = 'A')\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.12: Residual diagnostics and predictions 10 steps ahead from the ARMA(2,0) model estimated using the base-R function stats::arima().\n\n\n\n\nUsing the estimated residuals, \\(\\hat{\\epsilon}_t = Y_t - \\hat{Y}_t\\), we can get the ‘fitted’ values, \\(\\hat{Y}_t\\) (technically, these are one-step-ahead predictions), see Figure 4.13.\n\n\nCode\nFit <- Y - e\nggplot2::autoplot(Y) + \n    autolayer(Fit) +\n    ylab(\"Y\") +\n    theme_light()\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.13: Oberved time series (black) and one-step-ahead predictions (red) from the ARMA(2,0) model."
